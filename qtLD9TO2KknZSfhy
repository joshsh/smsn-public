* :qtLD9TO2KknZSfhy: appropriate broadcasting of status messages is a matter of privacy (for example, one might post to one's friends a status update which one would not want one's colleagues to see) as well as reduction of information noise (for example, status updates about one's personal life might be uninteresting those who follow us for professional news).  Users often have a particular audience in mind when they post a status message, which is defined by the confidentiality of the message, the audience's ability to understand the message, and/or the likelihood that the audience will be interested in it.  The notion of faceted presence allows for different data to be emitted to different observers, different granularity of data (e.g. sharing exact location with friends, and sharing only city/country with others), and different types of presence data (e.g. availability for professional discussion vs. availability for chat).  Sharing Spaces extends the OPO vocabulary so as to define the intended audience of a status message, taking advantage of Linked Data about users.
