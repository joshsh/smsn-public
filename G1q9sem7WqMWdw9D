* :G1q9sem7WqMWdw9D: science is driven by the goal of understanding, but it does not itself inform the goals of mankind.  Rather, it is a tool which can be used for different ends.  Perfection of means and confusion of goals seem (in Einstein's view) to characterize the modern age.  If even a minority of mankind strives for the safety, the welfare, and the free development of the talent of mankind, they will not be denied the means, and their superiority will be proven in the long run.
