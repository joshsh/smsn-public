* :wnYvweT95OUpEcWl: "In the next place I remark that the rudiments of memory are involved in the minimum of consciousness. The first beginnings of it appear in that minimum, just as the first beginnings of perception do. As each member of the change or difference, which goes to compose that minimum, is the rudiment of a single perception, so the priority of one member to the other, although both are given to consciousness in one empirical present moment, is the rudiment of memory. The fact, that the minimum of consciousness is difference or change in feelings, is the ultimate explanation of memory as well as of single perceptions. A former and a latter are included in the minimum of consciousness ; and this is what is meant by saying that all consciousness is in the form of time, or that time is the form of feeling, the form of sensibility."
