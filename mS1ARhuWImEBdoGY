* :mS1ARhuWImEBdoGY: on each of 1050 trials, each observer was presented with a light and a sound, separated by a SOA. An observer indicated whether or not the sound and light came on simultaneously by pressing one of two (yes or no) response keys; both the light and sound stimulus were switched off automatically once a response was made. (The stimuli were kept on until a response was obtained to ensure that observers could not base their responses on the SOA between fixed-length stimuli being switched off). Observers were requested to respond as quickly and as accurately as possible. The SOAs varied between -250 ms (sound first) and +250 ms (light first).  The first 50 trials were treated as practice  trials, and were discarded.  For the remaining 1000 trials, stimulus pairs with every SOA in the set S = {-250, -249, . . ., -1,  1, . . ., 2497 250} were presented twice, with SOAs being chosen from S in the same random order for all subjects.  The observer was given an opportunity to take a short break every 100 trials. The inter-trial interval varied randomly (with uniform  probability) between 1300 and 1700 ms.
