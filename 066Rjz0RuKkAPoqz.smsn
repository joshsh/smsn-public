@title these bones do not move in an entirely independent fashion. Specifically, it has been shown that the DIP joint angle depends on the PIP angle owing to interaction of tendons attached to middle and distal phalanges. Furthermore, as shown experimentally by during natural ï¬‚ex of the finger (i.e. when not explicitly controlling MCP independently of other joints) MCP joint angles depend on the PIP angle when bending the middle and distal phalanges.\uFB02ex of the finger (i.e. when not explicitly controlling MCP independently of other joints) MCP joint angles depend on the PIP angle when bending the middle and distal phalanges.
