Over the course of a lot of (? wide ranging) conversation that felt meaningful and insightful but none of which I remember, a French woman (? with similar attitudes and fascinatingly differences) and I (? fell in love). I wanted to touch her physically for a while (? without changing my apparent behavior), then we kissed and it was very nice.

Then I was doing something else, with no record of the transition. I receive a message (? audio) from her, which might have been "Is there no symbol for gratitude?" My response was something like, "I have not found a way to say `we should continue this in real life`".

Then I awoke.
