* :awsjQ4v2yDZHL161: a proposed space transportation system that carries payloads to and from low Earth orbit. It is intended to achieve orbital altitude and orbital velocity using low thrust rocket propulsion by flying in the manner of an airship rather than a rocket, employing buoyancy and aerodynamic lift rather than vertical thrust to sustain flight during its ascent
