@title "Throughout the Satanic Panics, the underlying subversion myth reflected anxieties about the decline of “traditional values” and the nuclear Christian family central to those values. Maybe that family never existed the way people thought it did. Maybe “traditional values” were only ever code for patriarchy or white supremacy or any number of other oppressions. That didn’t matter. The perception among many conservative Americans was that the droves of women entering the workforce, the droves of parents who chose to practice alternative religions or no religion at all, the droves of children shuffled off to day care and teenagers coming home to empty houses, represented an existential threat."
