* :R1H5LsUPoftAI2U9: "For spatial ventriloquism, it has long been known that listeners who heard a sound while seeing a spatially displayed flash had the (false) impression that the sound originated from the flash. This phenomenon was named the ventriloquist illusion, because it was considered a stripped-down version of what the ventriloquist does on stage (see, for reviews, Bertelson, 1999; Vroomen & de Gelder, 2004a)"
