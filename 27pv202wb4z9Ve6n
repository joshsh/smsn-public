* :27pv202wb4z9Ve6n: "When 2 successive clicks are presented to the ears either a single sound image or 2 successive sound images is perceived, depending on the temporal difference between the 2 stimuli. In agreement with previous findings, the time difference necessary for binaurally resolving 2 equally loud clicks was 1.8 msec. The comparable monaural threshold was 1.6 msec."
