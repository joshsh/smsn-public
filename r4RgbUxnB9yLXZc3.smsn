One syntactic device I use that might be confusing is that, when determining the order in which operators denoted by punctuation bind, those with a higher character count bind last. So, for instance, had I written this:

        + :ncDxdJq: view :::: :\rel &&& :\program
            Â· :Y-czoUN: :\ = isa

(the second line of which clarifies that :\ should be read as the "isa" relationship), the :::: binds last, the &&& before it, and the :\ symbols first. That is, a view isa rel, and a view isa program also.
```
