@title use an equity substitution strategy where you invest in dividend growth stocks for part of your bond portfolio.  A good example is AT&T common stock with a dividend yield of around 5% vs. AT&T 10-year bonds paying about half that.  Investors should be better off owning the stock (and similar dividend growth stocks) vs. the bonds in the same company
