@title the finger-pad of the palm (i.e. the fleshy part of the palm just below the finger) yields a readable signal if you hold the sensor just right.  Any place on the pad seems to work, although I had the most luck with the upraised peaks where my finger whorls come together in a triangle shape (there is one per finger).
