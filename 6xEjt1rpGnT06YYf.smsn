@title unfortunately, my voice recorder ran out of battery., so I was unable to record the flight. I charged the recorder on the drive to KRHV and noted full battery when I got there, but the device reported an empty battery when I tried to use it less than an hour later. At one point, the recorder fell and landed on a hard metal surface while I was setting up for the flight.
