@title Other kinds of quesitons, such as "Show me every story anybody at Slate Magazine has written about love," or "How many laws does California have that apply only to parents?" have no natural tabular representation; they are about other kinds of data. One can invent a tabular representation for them, but it is a heroic effort. Heroic in part because the solution will be very specific to the problem, not reusable in other contexts.
