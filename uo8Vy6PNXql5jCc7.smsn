@title one of the best things about ambient intelligence in the home is that an individual owns or at least has a large degree of control over his home, unlike most of the other spaces he finds himself in, which gives him a high degree of freedom in configuring his environment to suit his needs.  The home environment thus has more potential to adapt to the individual user than public spaces or shared work spaces do.
