Performance on the familiar items was higher than on the novel items, but performance on the latter improved over time. While the lack of improvement with the familiar items suggests memory-based performance, the improvement with novel items demonstrated generalized learning, indicating abstraction of the conversion rules such that they could be applied to interpret auditory patterns coding new visual information."
