* :gud0P6JA9Juwy0U9: "A perfect temporal coincidence is, however, not necessary for perceiving the ABE. In fact, the bounce percept is predominant (although less compelling) even when sounds are switched on before or after the disksâ€™ overlap (e.g., Remijn et al., 2004; R. Sekuler et al., 1997). The width of the temporal window of the bounce percept is about 200 msec (Watanabe & Shimojo, 2005), and the ABE is extinguished if the sound is presented out of this window (e.g., 300 msec before/after; Watanabe & Shimojo, 2001b)"
