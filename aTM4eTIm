* :TM4eTIm: "My research utilizes functional imaging (fMRI), computational techniques and behavioral methods to investigate visual recognition and high-level visual processes. For humans, visual recognition is a natural, effortless skill that occurs within a few hundreds of milliseconds, yet, it is one of the least understood aspects of visual perception. We investigate the underlying representations and cortical mechanisms that subserve recognition, and the relation between these neural processes, and our visual perception of the world."
