* :8W3IjcfK79aKwWYB: there was a man who created a sprinkler system for his garden which produced a very fine mist.  In the daytime, he was surrounded by rainbows whenever he sat on the back porch during the misting.  He then installed a lighting system such that he would also be surrounded by rainbows at night.
