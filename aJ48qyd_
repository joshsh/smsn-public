* :J48qyd_: "For audioâ€“visual stimuli that are repetitively presented in a stream, perception of synchrony breaks down if the temporal frequency is above ~4 Hz (Benjamins, van der Smagt, & Verstraten, 2008; Fujisaki & Nishida, 2005). Above this rate, observers are no longer able to discriminate whether the auditory and visual stimulus elements are synchronous, and the two modality streams are perceived as being segregated with no order between them"
