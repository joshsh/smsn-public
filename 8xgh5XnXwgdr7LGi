@title Arguably even more useful than a per-string choice of fret is a pair of buttons for each string to let you issue the instruction, "from this string and all strings above it, capo at the fret nearer to|farther from the headstock". (One reason that kind of combination instruction is useful is because in the circle of fifths, except when you run into the tritone irregularity, ascending by a fourth usually lands you back in the scale. Standard guitar tuning looks like this: Raise the pitch by fourths, then a glitch from the 3rd to the 2nd string, then resume rising by fourths.)
