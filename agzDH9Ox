* :gzDH9Ox: at first, John was disgusted that a skilled player of Yu-Gi-Oh! could be beaten by a little kid with rich parents who bought him an unbeatable deck (unlike Poker, for example, which is determined entirely by the skill of the player).  However, then he realized that real life was exactly the same: the deck of life is stacked in favor of rich, entitled people.  Kids who played Yu-Gi-Oh! and Pok√©mon were just experiencing that early.
