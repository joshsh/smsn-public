@title Knowledge graphs empower readers to make choices for themselves, and they empower readers and writers to work together. Writers can avoid the guesswork, and instead tailor content to different kinds of readers, or to different moods of the same reader: "follow these links for the scientific details behind this story", "follow these links for the mythological underpinnings of this idea", "follow these for sociological implications of these theories", etc.
