@title "Visual evoked potentials were recorded from 16 scalp locations on 10 young subjects during presentation of a series of high-quality photographs on a computer screen. The photographs consisted of equal numbers of pictures of fruit (citrus and non-citrus fruits), flowers (roses and other flowers) and objects (e.g. buildings, vehicles, animals etc.). [...] The pictures were presented under four odour conditions: no odour, rose odour, jasmine odour and citrus odour. [...] It is hypothesized that the N400 peak can be used as a measure of relatedness of a sensory stimulus to a previous or on-going prime, irrespective of the mode of the stimuli."
