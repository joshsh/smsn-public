The case for impulsive, extravagant consumerism
---
It is good to make money a good way, and bad to make money a bad way. This is not about making money, but spending it.

Extravagant spending -- buying "unreasonably" fancy rugs, for instance -- is a social good. It might not be as socially good as, say, sponsoring a child's education, or a whole family. But it sponsors someone (and indeed, often a family).

Conditional on one's work being good, extravagant spending is like ascetic charity -- "I worked for forty hours and all I took home was this chair."

Conversely, conditional on one's work being bad, extravagant spending makes it worse. If in order to spend money you have to kill unicorns, you should try to spend as little as possible.
