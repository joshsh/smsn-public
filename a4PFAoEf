* :4PFAoEf: This minimum time that is required for a correct judgment of temporal order between two sounds appears to be independent of their difference in frequency when the sounds are of different pitch. It is the same when one of the sounds is a tone and the other is a noise and when one of the sounds is a click and the other is a noise. Combinations of clicks with noises or tones that begin abruptly seem to result in greater sensitivity to small temporal differences but these changes, within the range of conditions studied, are small relative to the general agreement among all experimental conditions."
