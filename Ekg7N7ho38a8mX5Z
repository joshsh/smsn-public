@title If I focus perpetually on the next, and lose sight of the (diverse kinds of!) good work I'm doing, I feel like a bad person, and stressed. I should have faith in my body's rhythm. True, there are always more easy things on my to-do list that I could do now; but if I'm not doing them, there's a good chance it's because decompressing from the last push is worthwhile.
