@title oftentimes, I arrive at a Wikipedia page via a Wikipedia search (from Brain-mode) which gives me a page with a non-canonical URL.  I have to take care to compare the page title with the URL, and click the Talk tab, then the Article tab to get to the page with the canonical URL before generating the bookmark text with the Chrome extension
