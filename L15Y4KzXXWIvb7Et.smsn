@title [markdown]The knowledge graph is a cooperative game of reading and writing. It lets the self get swept up, literally, by a higher power: Intuitively, you sense the purpose that guided your community and your past self to the now. You build a sense, like an art, for what needs to be known, and it guides your reading, and your writing.
