given: sequence a_1, ..., a_n
goal: find longest palindromic subsequence
L(i, j) = longest palindromic subsequence between i and j (inclusive)
if a_i = a_j
    L(i, j) = 2 + L(i+1, j-1)
else
    L(i, j) = max{ L(i+1, j), L(i, j-1) }
Fill in upper left diagonals starting with i=j and stopping at (1, n)
Return (1, n)
