@title first you must extract, and especially collect at a range of temperatures and pressures in order to have an extract that is diverse in its compounds. Using a pump to conduct the entire operation at one pressure will produce mediocre results. If the extraction is done at low pressure <2600PSI it will be very aromatic but the yield is not as good. If it is done at high pressure >2600PSI it will have better efficiency and yield but a less aromatic oil
