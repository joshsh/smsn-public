@title "the problem with using the same items in testing and training is that the improvement cannot be attributed entirely to generalized learning because it could rather be reflective of an enhanced associative memory with the familiar items. In order to test for generalized crossmodal learning, it would be crucial to evaluate substitution performance with new stimuli."
