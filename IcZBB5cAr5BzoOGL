* :IcZBB5cAr5BzoOGL: Economists and others will tell you that you are equal to your information: your beliefs, your preferences, your choices. Those things are all rewritable. It's not even difficult: Study yourself, your feelings, your habits, your choices, etc., write some things down, label the relevant topics, read what others have written about those topics -- and you will literally transform your identity.
