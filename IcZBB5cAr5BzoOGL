* :IcZBB5cAr5BzoOGL: [markdown]Economists and others will tell you that you are equal to your information: your beliefs, your preferences, your choices. Those things are all rewritable. It's not even difficult: Study yourself, your feelings, your habits, your choices, etc., and you will literally transform your identity. It's a mechanical process! Just write some things down, label them, read what others have written under the same labels; just mess with your data, and you will transform yourself.
