* :jbhFAcA1X0WLPoFC: When SPD is recognized in children, it can be treated with a variety of sensory integration techniques. Itâ€™s when SPD is not discovered that it truly becomes a problem. Generally adults with SPD struggle more if they are easily overstimulated rather than under-stimulated. An adult with undiagnosed SPD might have panic attacks at the thought of overwhelming stimulus.
