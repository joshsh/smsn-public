Bartosz M, section 1.8 (Functoriality) of Category Theory:
"By duality, a coproduct, if itâ€™s defined for every pair of objects in a category, is also a bifunctor. In Haskell, this is exemplified by the Either type constructor being an instance of Bifunctor:"

But we only reversed some of the arrows!
