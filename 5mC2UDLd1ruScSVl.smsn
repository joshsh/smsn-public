@title motivation: some points from 4QL's README
@created 1593137661253
@text ```
4QL is a rule-based database query language with negation allowed in premises and conclusions of rules.
4QL is the first such language with tractable and at the same time intuitive semantics, even though the area of deductive databases is over 30 years old.
4QL is founded on a four-valued semantics with truth values: true, false, inconsistent and unknown.
