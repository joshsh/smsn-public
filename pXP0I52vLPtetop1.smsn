@title "The steepness at the crossover point reflects the observers’ sensitivity to temporal asynchronies. The steepness can also be expressed in terms of the just noticeable difference (JND—half the difference in SOA between the 25% and 75% point), and then it represents the smallest interval observers can reliably notice."
