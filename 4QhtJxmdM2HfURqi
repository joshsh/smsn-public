* :4QhtJxmdM2HfURqi: the ffr rate looks like the fed knew about the housing crisis; they raised rates from 1 to 5 between 2004 and 2007. strangely, that translated into little 10-year t-bond change, and hence (they always have about a 2% spread) the 30-year mortgage rate. the global savings glut might be why (bernanke proposed that then).
