@title The latency of perception can impose limits on the race and efficiency of behavior. This is most obvious when the latency is artificially increased; normal speech is typically disrupted if a speaker's voice is tape recorded and played back to him via earphones after a delay of 50 to 250 msec. Under these conditions of delayed feedback, speech shows slowing, blocking, slurring, and syllable repetition (Lee, 1950).
