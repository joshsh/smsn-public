@title "When presented with two stimuli, one auditory and the other visual, an observer can perceive them either as referring to the same unitary audiovisual event or as referring to two separate unimodal events. The binding versus segregation of these unimodal stimuli—what Bedford (2001) calls the object identity decision; see also Radeau and Bertelson (1977)—depends on both low-level (i.e.,  stimulus-driven) factors, such as the spatial and temporal co-occurrence of the stimuli (Calvert, Spence, & Stein, 2004; Welch, 1999), as well as on higher level (i.e., cognitive) factors, such as whether or not the participant assumes that the stimuli should “go together.” This is the so-called “unity assumption,” the assumption that a perceiver makes about whether he or she is observing a single multisensory event rather than multiple separate unimodal events—a decision that is made, at least in part, on the basis of the consistency of the information available to each sensory modality (Welch & Warren, 1980, p. 663; see also Laurienti, Kraft, Maldjian, Burdette, & Wallace, 2004),1 and on the basis of perceptual grouping (Lyons, Sanabria, Vatakis, & Spence, 2006; Radeau & Bertelson, 1987; Sanabria, Soto-Faraco, Chan, & Spence, 2004; Spence, Sanabria, & Soto-Faraco, 2007; Thomas, 1941) and phenomenal causality (Guski & Troje, 2003; Michotte, 1946)."
