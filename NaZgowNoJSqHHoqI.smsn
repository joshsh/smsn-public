@title "Two experiments were conducted to examine the effects of audiovisual temporal asynchrony on syllable identification and simultaneity judgment. The major finding was that AV speech inputs are extremely tolerant to bimodal asynchrony, and that bimodal information separated in time by as much as 200 ms is usually perceived as simultaneous. Specifically, both the identification experiment and the subjective simultaneity judgment experiment revealed temporal windows of maximal AV integration of about 200 ms."
