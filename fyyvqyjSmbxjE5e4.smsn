Question: how do we remove all these new facts when we no longer want them? After all, if we give the command

   ?-  retract(lookup(X,Y,Z)).
Prolog will go through all the facts one by one and ask us whether we want to remove them! But thereâ€™s a much simpler way. Simply use the command

   ?-  retractall(lookup(_,_,_)).
```
