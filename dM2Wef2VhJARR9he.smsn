@title to try out the laser (on 2012-09-15), I soldered a small piece of 22 AWG wire to the end of each of the wire leads (which were a bit too thin to mate with my jumper wires), then insulated the soldering point with plastic wrap (sealed in place with the heat gun).  Now I can easily connect the laser to a breadboard for experimentation.
