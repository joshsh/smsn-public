@title "Thus, the appearance of cross-modal matching capability early during human infant development is seemingly inconsistent with the protracted developmental time course observed for the appearance of multisensory integrative capacity in the animal model as assessed at the level of the single neuron. In fact, the conflict is more apparent than real. As discussed below, the relatively common usage of the term ‘multisensory integration’ to refer to all manner of multisensory phenomena tends to obscure the fact that results from human infant studies and animal studies probably reflect the operation of very different underlying processes.")
