* :f8ff70v85p431IXH: "As described above, interactional synchrony appears increase, as measured by untrained observers, when an ambient display is used to amplify the nonverbal signals associated rapport. This is an important finding when taking into account the available empirical evidence that links synchronous movement to feelings of trust, smoothness in an interaction, and relationship building [22, 37]. What is of further interest is the finding that although participants’ nonverbal communication was perceived to have changed when the ambient display responded to behavioural manifestations of rapport, participants were unaware of this change. The statistically significant change in nonverbal communication did not impact upon the participants’ self reports of rapport."
