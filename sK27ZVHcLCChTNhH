@title "On the guard side, we can do age waivers a lot easier, but 35 is about the limit we want to work with. That's because the appliation process from start to WOCS is generally 12-18mos if you already have basic & AIT done. Then Rucker is two years. Then AQC & RL progression... you're talking about getting a fully qualified pilot at 40. Too much of that is hard on the unit's long term manning."
