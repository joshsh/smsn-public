@title for the RHV to PAO leg, I essentially repeated my radio calls from a dual flight with Scott on 2019-06-15. I again transitioned through KSJC and KNUQ airspace, but had some unexpected difficulty at KPAO due to the setting sun, which was right in front of me and made it hard for me to spot the field. I overflew the field  and cicled back, entering right pattern for runway 31. The tower was not in operation, despite what the AF/D had said about hours of operation. I taxied to transient parking after landing and spent some time eating a snack and tweeting an image from my flight, leaving for KSQL late enough to log my takeoff for night currency. I had read a NOTAM that the VASI at KSQL was not in service, but chose to go anyway, and reflect on personal runway lighting minimums after I got there and experienced the approach.
