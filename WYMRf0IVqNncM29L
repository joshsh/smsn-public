We will not lose booklike experiences: Write a tour. And in both you can create "tours": long paths that take you from one passage to the next. Novels, articles, and other things are tours. A tour is a series of connections of the form "read this after reading that".

The ease with which other users can record metadata means that when you read a book-form tour in the graph, you'll be able to see which users found which parts useful for what, which parts are critical for understanding something later in the tour. When users share (a vocabulary of) goals, one user's feelings can guide another.
