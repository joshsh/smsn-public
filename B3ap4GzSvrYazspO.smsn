@title the only challenge so far has been in getting Arduino to run on Eddie4.  I was stymied by a strange segfault at first, which persisted regardless of which version of Arduino I tried, and in spite of the fact that Processing ran normally.  Eventually, I found a note at the bottom of a BBS thread which solved everything: someone had found that a specific version of the RXTX binaries had fixed a similar segfault.  A light went on in my head, since I had tampered with my own RXTX libraries while trying to get the faulty Wowbagger I to communicate with Eddie over the serial port.  Installing the precompiled librxtxSerial.so (and also librxtxParallel.so) from rxtx-2.2pre2-bins.zip did the trick.
