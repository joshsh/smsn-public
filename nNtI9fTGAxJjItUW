First normal form (1NF) sets the very basic rules for an organized database:
    * Eliminate duplicative columns from the same table.
    * Create separate tables for each group of related data and identify each row with a unique column or set of columns (the primary key). 
Second normal form (2NF) further addresses the concept of removing duplicative data:
    * Meet all the requirements of the first normal form.
    * Remove subsets of data that apply to multiple rows of a table and place them in separate tables.
    * Create relationships between these new tables and their predecessors through the use of foreign keys. 
Third normal form (3NF) goes one large step further:
    * Meet all the requirements of the second normal form.
    * Remove columns that are not dependent upon the primary key. 
Finally, fourth normal form (4NF) has one additional requirement:
    * Meet all the requirements of the third normal form.
    * A relation is in 4NF if it has no multi-valued dependencies.
