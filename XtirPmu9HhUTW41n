@title "it is important to realize that in spatial ventriloquism, there is not a complete capture of sound by vision but, rather, a mutual attraction in space. The effect of vision on sound location is usually robust, whereas reverse effect—sound attracting visual location—is usually quite subtle and has mostly been observed with visual displays that are difficult to localize (Alais & Burr, 2004b; Bertelson & Radeau, 1981, 1987)"
