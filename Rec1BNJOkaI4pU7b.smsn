@title "On each trial, subjects were presented with either a visual stimulus alone, an auditory stimulus alone, or a combined visual/auditory (cross-modal) stimulus (Fig. 1). The visual stimulus was either a red or blue filled circle that subtended 7.7Â° of visual angle and that was presented on a black background. The duration of each visual stimulus was 250 ms. The auditory stimuli were verbalizations of either the word red or the word blue and were 350 ms in duration. For delivery of the cross-modal stimulus pairs, the visual and auditory stimulus onsets were simultaneous."
