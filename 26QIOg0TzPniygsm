* :26QIOg0TzPniygsm: "There are many multisensory processes that do not involve such a product and for which the inferences that are drawn are quite different. For example, the cross-modal matching studies discussed above seek the identification of equivalencies in two objects, scenes or events and, unlike studies of neurophysiological multisensory integration, they require the preservation of the characteristics of the stimulation in each modality. Only then can they be matched."
