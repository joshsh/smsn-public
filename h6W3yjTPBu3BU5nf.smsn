@title often you have a piece of paper full of notes from a particular context (e.g. notes you took during a meeting), but you don't know where to put the context in your knowledge base.  You're faced with three options: think long and hard about where to put the context (something you often don't have time to do), just put it any old place (and risk never seeing those notes again), or put the notes aside mentally or physically until it occurs to you where to put them
