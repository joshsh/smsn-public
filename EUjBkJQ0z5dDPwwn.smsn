@title Bosch et al. [per 2013-12-20 issue of Science] found that sleep deprivation decreases functional connectivity between the posterior cingulate cortex and the bilateral anterior cingulate cortex.  In contrast, connectivity between the dorsal nexus (a region that plays a crucial role in the patho physiology of depression) and two areas within the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex are increased.  These sleep deprivation-induced changes in resting-state connectivity indicate a shift in dominance from a more affective to a more cognitive network
