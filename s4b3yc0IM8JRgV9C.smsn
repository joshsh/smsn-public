@title Also! Map inside and out. When you write "inside" a topic, you are writing about how that thing works, how it happens, what it is. When you write "outside" the topic, you write about how it connects to other things -- what purposes it serves, what other projects and goals it helps or hurts, what beliefs and systems it assumes, which ones it contradicts.
