* :6LxvfJe0y3MpHSRv: if we ask a man, "Who was your girlfriend in 1968?" and ask him to report his strategy for the answer, his reply is roughly: "First I thought about where I was and what I was doing in 1968.  Then I remembered who I used to go out with then."  In other words, it really isn't possible to answer such a question by a direct look-up.  List of "past girlfriends" do not exist in memory.  Such a list must be constructed.  the process by which that list is constructed is a search through episodes organized around times and locations in memory.
