The key command isn't really done at that point -- it will propmt the user for switches. For instance:

`d d` brings you to a dedicated diff buffer
`d s` brings you to a dedicated diff buffer, for only staged changes
etc.

For details on what can be done after pressing the first `d`, read about the "diff popup", e.g. here:
