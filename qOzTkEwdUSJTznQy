* :qOzTkEwdUSJTznQy: it seems that wealthier societies tend to value punctuality more highly, with the Swiss as an oft-cited example.  However, there are also counterexamples.  I Googled to get an idea of the importance of punctuality in the top 10 nations by GDP per capita, and the results were as follows: Luxembourg, Norway, Switzerland, Hong Kong, and the United States are particularly keen on punctuality, while it is relatively unimportant in Qatar, Brunei, Kuwait, and the United Arab Emirates.  In Singapore, punctuality appears to be relatively important, yet something people struggle with, as in China and Korea.  I found little information on tiny San Marino, but I would guess that attitudes there are similar to those in Italy, i.e. relaxed.
