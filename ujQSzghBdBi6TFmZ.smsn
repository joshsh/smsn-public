@title [markdown]Just as the reader forecasts the writing, the writer forecasts the reading. The writer imagines an "average reader", and tries to choose the Optimal Path for that imaginary being. Explain in enough detail, but not too much. Include this but discard that, based on who is likely to care about what. There are an infinity of paths by which a reader might traverse the information. Traditional linear writing means guessing what readers need, and selecting a single Optimal Path for them.
