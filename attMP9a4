Is #evil any different from exploitation? Someone can specialize in exploitation -- in recognizing when they can get (an unreasonably large fraction of) what, and knowing how to take it (from who). In fact it is so easy that someone who knows nothing about anything else -- Donald Trump -- can run for president.

The laws might get fixed! We live in a flexible demoncracy. As importantly, we can each do the equivalent locally, for ourselves. We can learn to recognize evil, and lies, and the intentions and influences behind them. (We can also learn to recognize our own prejudices, when we imagine the wrong intentions onto someone.) 

It is a difficult problem.

(Voter) apathy|despair is wrong. We can know each other.

And it feels good! Fear of knowing is a state of ignorance. Such fearful ignorance -- that the truth is unknowable (false!), because everyone|the powerful is a liar (false!), or everybody is selfish (false!) and nobody will change --  from the inside, those fears feel like the truth. 

Escaping those fears is surprising, beautiful, ecstatic. It is like coming home.
