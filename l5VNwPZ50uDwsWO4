* :l5VNwPZ50uDwsWO4: often, you can either create a long plain-English note which contains all of the necessary information in a single value, or a concise header with multiple children.  If one is not concerned about wasted space, noise in search results, or the fact that the children do not conform to any known schema, it may be helpful to see the information thus broken out into bullets.  Otherwise, it is better to compact it into the one note
