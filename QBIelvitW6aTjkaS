I installed Haskell-emacs by running "package-list-packages" and selecting it. That compiled and initialized it. When I started a new Emacs session, the haskell-emacs package was no longer initialized. 

My .emacs file includes some auto-generated code that seems intended to load haskell-emacs on startup:

```
(custom-set-variables
 ;; custom-set-variables was added by Custom.
 ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful.
 ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance.
 ;; If there is more than one, they won't work right.
 '(package-archives
   (quote
    (("gnu" . "http://elpa.gnu.org/packages/")
     ("melpa-stable" . "http://stable.melpa.org/packages/"))))
 '(package-selected-packages (quote (haskell-emacs haskell-mode))))
(package-initialize)
```

One of the examples suggested in the haskell-emacs README is to run  `(Matrix.identity 1)`. In the (still-open) Emacs session from which I installed haskell-emacs, I can go to *scratch* and evaluate that, and it prints `((1))` to the *Messages* buffer.

However, in any new Emacs session, if I go to the *scratch* buffer and evaluate the same expression, I get an `eval: Symbolâ€™s function definition is void: Matrix\.identity` error.
