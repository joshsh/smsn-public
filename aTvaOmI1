Connect each node in X with an edge from the super-source.
Each edge from X to Y shall be ordered in that direction.
Connect each node in Y with an edge to the super-sink.
Each edge has capacity 1.
    
Claim: Every integer flow... <==> a matching...
Proof:
    Every matching (of size m) corresponds to a flow (of size m).
        ...
    Every flow (of size m) corresponds to a matching (of size m).
        ...
    Time complexity:
        O(m*C) flow algorithm is appropriate, as the flow is small (no bigger than the number of nodes)
            --> O(m*n)
