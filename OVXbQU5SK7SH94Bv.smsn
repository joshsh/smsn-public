@title Wikipedia states that conduction velocities of myelinated neurons vary with the square root of axon diameter, while the conduction velocities of unmyelinated neurons rise linearly with axon diameter. The lodical intersection point appears to be around 1 micron and 2 m/s, while myelinated velocities range as high as 60 m/s in cats
