@title [markdown]If that seems unlikely, there is a simple economic explanation: Systems like Google's are optimized for computer reasoning, whereas Semantic Synchrony is optimized for human reasoning. Currently, computers can only reason on a graph that adheres to some fixed schema, which limits what can be expressed, and how. Semantic Synchrony imposes no such limitation; knowledge in the graph is just text, written however you like.
