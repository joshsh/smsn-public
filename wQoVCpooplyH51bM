* :wQoVCpooplyH51bM: [markdown] In a knowledge graph, readers and writers can build on each others' work. Two passages can be created by two different users, and connected by a third user. A user can classify passages "true", "beautiful", "funny", "peaceful", "helpful for understanding economics", "to learn by tuesday", "to mention the next time I talk to Luis". Classifications can overlap -- you might label a passage "science" and "dramatic" while I label it "stories about spaceships". Readers can choose where to go and what to see based on that kind of metadata.
