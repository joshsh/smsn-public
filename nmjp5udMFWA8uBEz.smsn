@title [markdown]Move-submode provides a faster way to change those three properties: Press `s` for sharability, `p` for priority, or `w` for weight, and then press `0` for 0, `1` for 0.25, `2` for 0.5, `3` for 0.75, or `4` for 1.0. (In fact you can use `z` for 0, `a` for 1, `s` for 2, `d` for 3 an`d` f for 4; it's a little faster.)
