@title it follows that the evolution of language has been unchanged since the time of our last common ancestor (perhaps 50,000 years ago).  50,000 years before that, there's no evidence in the archeological record that language existed at all.  So somewhere in that very narrow (in evolutionary terms) window, there seems to have been an explosion of creativity, complex social organization, symbolic behavior, records of astronomical events, etc.  This is sometimes called the Great Leap Forward.
