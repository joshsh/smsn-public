@title "We further distinguish whether an effect is an immediate effect or an aftereffect. Immediate effects refer to the direct perceptual consequences of presenting conflicting information in two modalities. Immediate effects are informative in telling whether the information sources were integrated or not. Aftereffects are measured later, and they can tell whether the modalities were readjusted or recalibrated, relative to each other, so that, in the future, they remain aligned in space or time."
