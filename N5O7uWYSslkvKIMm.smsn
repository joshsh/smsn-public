@title Maybe the weirdest thing that ever happened to me: I was at my neighbor's place when I lived in Seattle and maybe more than five of us had just gotten stoned. I noticed that the TV antenna was in an unusual shape, a simple tree with maybe 3 or 5 joints and strange angles. Then I discovered I was seeing it in two states, until one of those states vanished or unified with the other. Before or after that, I remember wondering, "Does anyone else see this?" and though I probably collected data on the project, I did not think to try to direct anyone's attention to the antenna, to see whether they saw what I saw.
