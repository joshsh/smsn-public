@title perhaps my use of SmSn, like the use of caffeine for productivity, is an unhealthy behavior which will lead to ever-increasing levels of dependence and burnout.  The more I use, the more I am committed to using and the more I need to use.  What is the difference between a helpful tool and a harmful habit?
