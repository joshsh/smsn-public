@title [markdown][Semantic Synchrony](https://github.com/synchrony/smsn/wiki) is a free, open-source knowledge graph editor. More than a "graph database," it also includes a user-friendly client for editing the graph. This means you do not have to be a programmer to use Semantic Synchrony; you only need to know English, or some other natural language.
