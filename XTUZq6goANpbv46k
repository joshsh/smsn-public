2 cups water
2 cups whole milk
2 tbsp. Assam tea
3 tbsp. raw/turbinado/demerara sugar (or more, to taste)
1 tsp. freshly grated ginger (or much more, for "kick")
{
  1/4 tsp. ground black peppercorns (or more, to taste)
  4 whole cloves
  4 cardamom pods, bruised
  1 cinnamon stick, broken into pieces
} OR {
  1/4 tbsp. pre-ground masala chai powder
  same proportions as above, except 25% as much cinnamon
}

1) bring water, ginger, pepper, cloves, cardamom pods and cinnamon to a boil in a pot
2) add the milk and sugar to the pot and bring to a boil once again
3) remove pot from heat and add the loose black tea
4) cover and let steep for at least 3 minutes (I steep for 10, making the tea very strong)
5) strain and serve
