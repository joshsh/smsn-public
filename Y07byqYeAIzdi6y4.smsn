@title "At the very least, Ludwig et al.'s (2011) results provide one of the first examples that animals exhibit crossmodal correspondences much like the rest of us. They also place the chimp somewhat above the ‘clever’ dogs tested by researchers in Vienna. For while the latter canines could apparently match the sight and sound of a dog of the appropriate size, their gaze to a large or small dog image (tested in a preferential looking paradigm) wasn't influenced by the presentation of a high or low pitched tone (Faragó et al., 2010). The latter result was taken to suggest that man's best friend is simply not smart enough to make such symbolic, or abstract, cross-sensory matches."\u2018clever\u2019 dogs tested by researchers in Vienna.
