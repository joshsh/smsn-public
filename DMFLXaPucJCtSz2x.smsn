@title "The advantages of the data-driven approaches are the capabilities of handling uncertainty and temporal information. However, this method requires large datasets for training and learning, and suffers from the data scarcity or the “cold start” problem. It is also difficult to apply learnt activity models from one person to another. As such, this method suffers from the problems of scalability and reusability."
