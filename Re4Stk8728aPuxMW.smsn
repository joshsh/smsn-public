@title "One possibility for using this approach is to designate ‘cross-modal’ to describe the stimulus complex (e.g. visual and auditory) and ‘modality-specific’ to describe its individual components (visual or auditory). The resultant neural processes, as well as the neurons and the neural circuits involved in these processes, would be referred to as ‘multisensory’ (or ‘unisensory’)."\u2018cross-modal\u2019 to describe the stimulus complex (e.g. visual and auditory) and \u2018modality-specific\u2019 to describe its individual components (visual or auditory).
