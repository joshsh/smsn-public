@title "Even more specifically, the acquisition of reading is accompanied by a change in subjective experience: written words no longer appear as colored shapes but as meaningful graphemes and words, which get easily and naturally associated to sounds (i.e., either ones that one imaginatively hears, see Spence and Deroy, in press for a discussion; or ones that one should articulate, see Galantucci et al., 2006 for a review). No such documented change in experience, to our knowledge, has been observed as a consequence of the progressive establishment of visuo-tactile crossmodal transfer (see Held et al., 2011)."
