* :YQbCAR6UlVXGFz2b: "we are developing automatic interest detectors that remove the restrictions imposed by use of preset questions and the requirement that explicitly `bookmarkâ€™ interesting people/events. Instead we aspire to measure interest directly from normal human behavior. We are also developing an affiliation classifier that aims to infer relationships between subjects without any such explicit labels. A person should be able to pick up a badge, wear it, and have the system learn the group of people with whom he associates."
