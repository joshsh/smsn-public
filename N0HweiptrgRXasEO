@title "The level of performance achieved through any of these sensory substitution devices remains however inferior to any of the perceptual standards we know of. If one considers the standards of the intact stimulated modality (audition or touch), sensory substitution is lower in terms of speed and accuracy, and lower in terms of automaticity and effort."
