@title Hirsch cites some work by Helmholtz on reaction time, giving a minimal figure of 125-200ms, derived from results on nervous transmission time, which varies by individual.  Hirsch notes that it would be interesting to test Helmholtz's predictions experimentally, although it doesn't serve his purposes as an astronomer.
