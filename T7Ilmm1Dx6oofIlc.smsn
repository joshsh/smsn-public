@title because the wrist is restricted by the arm as to the distance it can travel, displacement accelerations which are very slow (low frequency) must also be very low in amplitude, and high-amplitude accelerations due to displacement must be of relatively high frequency.  In contrast, rotational changes may be quite high (up to 2g), irrespective of their frequency
