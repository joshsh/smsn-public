* :tUV6e5wojhD4T8Dd: A note's text can have any length. The note also has an `address`, a set of 16 alphanumeric characters. Addresses are usually provided between ":" marks, so they look something like this: `:axMIDS0EmKQXqMnm:`. In addition to text and address, notes have other properties, described later.
