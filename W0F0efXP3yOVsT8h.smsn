@title the location of the turns-around-a-point drill was intentionally chosen at the base of a steep hill in order to force me (the student) to think critically about the proper altitude for the maneuver. I was told to descend to 1500' MSL, but the instructor then asked whether it would put me too close to the top of the hill. By my estimation, I would still be over 600' above the top of the hill on the uphill side of my circuit, so I proceeded to do the maneuver at the requested altitude.
