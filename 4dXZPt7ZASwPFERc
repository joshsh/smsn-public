@title "From the physiological perspective, integration refers to the creation of a true product (i.e. neural signal) derived from an interaction among two or more different sensory inputs (e.g. see Stein & Meredith, 1993). That integrated neural signal is different (e.g. bigger, smaller, having a different temporal evolution) than each of the presumptive component responses, and cannot readily be deconstructed to yield the unique contributions to its formation."
