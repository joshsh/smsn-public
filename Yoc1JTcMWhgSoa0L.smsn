@title an athlete who seeks to reduce body fat must be careful not to lose lean muscle as well. Meal timing, protein intake, workout intensity and workout type must be factored into an athleteâ€™s body fat reduction plan. Deprivation is not the key to body fat reduction; rather, an athlete should focus on revving the metabolism and discouraging his body from storing fat
