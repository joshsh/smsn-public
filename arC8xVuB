* :rC8xVuB: in a temperature controlled system not utilizing pumps this happens naturally. As you increase the pressure through heat a range is experienced by the plant material. As the solution is released and collected this happens again. This is a good reason to keep the collection as slow as possible so the solution is collected at each position within the range for as long as is sensible. What you end up with is an oil that has the properties of an extract collected at all of the ranges versus the high selectivity of keeping the solvent at an even pressure and temperature
