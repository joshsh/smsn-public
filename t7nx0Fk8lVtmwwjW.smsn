@title the time complexity of this algorithm, using Fibonacci heaps in the implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm, is O(V2log V + VE): the algorithm uses O(VE) time for the Bellman–Ford stage of the algorithm, and O(V log V + E) for each of V instantiations of Dijkstra's algorithm. Thus, when the graph is sparse, the total time can be faster than the Floyd–Warshall algorithm, which solves the same problem in time O(V3)
