@title "Low-level perceptual learning is a good test bed for multisensory benefits, because learning is typically very slow, requiring many days of training 6, 7, 26, 27 and 28, and has been shown to be mediated by early visual areas of the brain 10, 26, 29, 30 and 31 that are traditionally thought to be highly unimodal [23]."
