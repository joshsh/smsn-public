* :YQn3rofdbVedVcWU: "It has been argued that whenever two or more sensory inputs are perceived as being highly consistent (i.e., as being related in a way that they appear to “go together”),2 observers will be more likely to treat them as referring to a single audiovisual event (Jackson, 1953; Welch & Warren, 1980). They will then be more likely to assume that such inputs have a common spatiotemporal origin, and will therefore be more likely to bind them into a single multisensory perceptual object or event (Bedford, 2001; cf. Corballis, 1994)."
