@title [markdown]In a traditional table of contents or filesystem, there is also a useful "tree" concept. However, in contrast to those, the graph allows multiple, overlapping trees to coexist. By having multiple parents, a note in the graph can effectively "be" in more than one "place" at once. Whereas in a traditional filesystem, files can become so far apart that they get lost, in a graph, any two things that should be neighbors can be neighbors, forever and ever, simply by adding a relationship from one to the other. There is no red shift, no rule of entropy, no universal expansion ripping the data apart.
