* :jGvPNtxJ8DRgjNvS: the 1850 census has Peter Chinevert, a carpenter of 53, with wife Angelique and children Lucelle?, Francis, Carliice?. A couple of checkmarks indicate that neither he nor his wife can read and write. Peter Chinevert Jr. who is presumably a son, has his own entries (but can read and write).  His entire family was born in Canada, and even Peter Jr.'s family was born there except for the youngest two, indicating that they have immigrated within the last 6 years, i.e. 1844 or later.  No indication of province of origin.
