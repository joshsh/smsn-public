@title Loving-kindness is greater than charity in three ways.  Charity is done with one's money, while loving-kindness is done with one's money or with one's person.  Charity is given only to the poor, while loving-kindness may be given both to the poor and to the rich.  Charity is given only to the living, while loving-kindness may be shown to both the living and the dead.
