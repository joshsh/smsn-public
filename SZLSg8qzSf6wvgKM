* :SZLSg8qzSf6wvgKM: e.g. when I entered an article co-authored by Jans on 2013-05-31, I could have then looked for Jans, created a "some things Jans has written" note under him, then added the article.  However, I am busy with other things and I did not do this.  If EoB were to simplify the process to the point of just needing to search for and select Jans, then confirm the result, that information might have made it into my knowledge graph
