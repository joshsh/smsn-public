@title "building activity models is to exploit rich prior knowledge in the domain of interest to construct activity models directly using knowledge engineering and management technologies. This usually involves knowledge acquisition, formal modeling, and representation. Activity models generated in this method are normally used for activity recognition or prediction through formal logical reasoning, e.g., deduction, induction, or abduction. As such, this method is referred to as knowledgedriven or top-down approach."
