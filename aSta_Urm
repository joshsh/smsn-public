* :Sta_Urm: "According to the load-insensitivity criterion, a process is automatic if it is not hindered when the simultaneous information load goes up – such as, for example, when the perceptual load of a participant’s task is increased (Lavie, 2005). This is usually assessed by means of performance in dual-task interference paradigms: For example, by investigating whether performance in one task is affected by varying the perceptual resources that simultaneously need to be allocated by a participant to a second task (Alsius et al., 2005, 2007; Eramudugolla, Kamke, Soto-Faraco, & Mattingley, 2011; Helbig & Ernst, 2008; Santangelo & Spence, 2008; Spence, 2010)."
