@title physical timestamps may be not be updated once added to the database. Logical timestamps, on the other hand, "are always subject to change, since discrepancies between the history (a sequence of events or time intervals) as it actually occurred and the representation of the history as stored in the database will often be detected after the fact. The distinction then is between permitting only appends and permitting arbitrary modifications."
