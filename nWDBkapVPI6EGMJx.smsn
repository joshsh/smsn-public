@title this was my stage 1 check with Jason Brown. The GPS track shows us departing to the southeast out of right traffic from 31R, then taking a left turn into the hills, doing some turns and possible stalls, then heading over to the Calaveras Reservoir, where we did some more procedures. Nowhere do I see a 360-degree turn except for my turns around a point (which don't look too bad).
