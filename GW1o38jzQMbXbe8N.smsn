@title TTL in RocksDB is non-strict: "key-values inserted are meant to be removed from the db in a non-strict 'ttl' amount of time therefore, this guarantees that key-values inserted will remain in the db for at least ttl amount of time and the db will make efforts to remove the key-values as soon as possible after ttl seconds of their insertion"
