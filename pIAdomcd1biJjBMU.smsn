@title "Another way of appreciating this is to recognize that cross-modal matching tests whether an association between cross-modal features has been established. This association may occur with any two arbitrary correlated features, or through a common amodal variable. Computationally, if two sensory features are cues to the same amodal variable (e.g. gender, intensity, motion, etc.), these features are statistically dependent and thus associated. While association between any two features in different senses is necessary for multisensory integration, it is not sufficient. For example, the nervous system may quickly learn that when an object moves it makes a sound. However, it may take much longer for the nervous system to learn how to combine the two sources of information in order to obtain a more precise estimate of the speed and direction of an objectâ€™s motion. While the former type of learning may require a simple associative mechanism, the latter may require the learning of how to encode the uncertainty of each sensory estimate and how to combine the two estimates given their uncertainty. Therefore, it is not unlikely that the two processes would have different developmental onsets and trajectories."
