@title this was a "scraping the rust off" sort of lesson, after an absence of over three months due to the difficulty of getting on a tailwheel CFI's regular schedule. Scott had been my favorite CFI at RHV, so I just waited until he was available. Although it was great to get back in the air, I found I was indeed very rusty. My takeoffs and landings, pattern, and other basics were all more less passable, yet pretty shaky. My takeoff was unclean, my radio calls a little sloppy. I overshot final on one landing, came in too low on another, came in too high on yet another and went around after I executed a less-than-perfect slip and ended up far right of the centerline. I had dropped below pattern altitude when approaching the airfield, forgotten key details of power-off stalls and slow flight, etc. etc. On top of all of that, I had not brought my audio cable, so was not able to record the flight. Although I had put fresh batteries in my headset and turned it on, it was apparently in stereo mode, and also promptly turned off again, so that I flew with audio only in my left ear, with no noise cancellation. Despite all of this, Scott assured me I had done well considering the long absence. Looking forward to tomorrow.
