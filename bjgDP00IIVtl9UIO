* :bjgDP00IIVtl9UIO: "Neural and subjective responses to electrical stimulation of the ulnar nerve in the arm were measured as a function of the interval between two successive stimuliâ€¦ . Both were found to increase monotonically as the interpulse interval increased. The results suggest that subjective intensity in this modality is a simple additive function of the amplitude of the neural response within the range of interpulse intervals studied here."
