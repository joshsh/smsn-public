* :ZcrtAUbkzlufFlP6: developing ideas of a certain complexity requires periods of uninterrupted concentration, and regular duties (e.g. of administration) interrupt that concentration.  Feynman has invented the myth that he is irresponsible (e.g. by refusing to be on committees) so as to create time to concentrate.  He's "actively irresponsible".  It's selfish, he says, but he wants to do physics.
