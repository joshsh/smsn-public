* :pqfzW5u: "What are the neuronal mechanisms that underlie network oscillatory synchrony in the thalamocortical system? Such oscillations are related to cognitive processes, normal sleep activities and certain forms of epilepsy. Our approach is an analysis of the cells and microcircuits that make up thalamic and cortical circuits. We also use computational approaches to build physiologically constrained network models to test and improve our understanding of the circuit."
