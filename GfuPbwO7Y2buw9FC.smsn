@title "[a budget in Mint] doesn't do you much good if you don't visit Mint often. The best way to keep up with your budget is to set aside some time, once a week or so, to review your budget. Half of this is going to be fiddling with Mint, and the other half is going to be reassessing how much you have left to spend next week (or for the rest of the month, year, etc.)"
