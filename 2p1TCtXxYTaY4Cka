* :2p1TCtXxYTaY4Cka: "The present and the previous studies seem to suggest how the attentional and the sound congruency components of the ABE interact and suggest that the two components may interact in an additive (i.e., not multiplicative) fashion. This is supported by the results of the experiments in which only one of the two components was acted on: They all showed an increment in the number of bounce responses of the multimodal condition, in comparison with the unimodal (i.e., visual only) condition."
