@title On this second lesson with Scott, we flew out to the Calaveras Reservoir for some ascending and descending maneuvers including the falling leaf. We then returned to RHV to work on landings. Scott "componentized" several landings such that he worked the stick, while I worked the rudder. This worked well for smoothing out my next landing w.r.t. side-to-side control. I was half decent on the landing flair as well, but came down on the mains a little hard due to releasing back-pressure on the stick.
