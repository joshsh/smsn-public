* :VQXpzPedfFkkYqNQ: by the same argument, we have no proof that a man thinks unless we are that man and we find ourselves thinking.  Generally, we accept the polite convention that everyone thinks.

There is something of a paradox connected with any attempt to localize consciousness, but we do not need to solve it before we can answer the question [of whether a machine can play the imitation game].
