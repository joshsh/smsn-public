@title "That discrimination performance becomes worse when subjects learn to integrate (or associate) signals may seem counterintuitive at first. This is because it is often implied that there should always be a benefit from integration. As can be seen here, however, this intuition is wrong because there is also a cost involved in integrating signals. This cost, as a signature of integration, can be revealed using a discrimination task for which detecting the discrepancy between the signals becomes important."
