@title Our spontaneous tendency is to break up any monotonously given series of sound into some sort of rhythm.  We involuntarily accentuate every second, or third, or fourth beat, or we break the series in still more intricate ways.  Whenever we thus grasp the impressions in rhythmic form, we can identify a longer string of them without confusion.
