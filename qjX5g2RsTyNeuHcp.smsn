@title the Hummingbird was tested in two "unfamiliar" settings -- a rock music festival and an academic conference.  In both settings, the Hummingbirds provided a sense of connection and disconnection which was unusual and difficult to describe, and which positively enhanced to experience.  However, users were not certain that they wanted the devices to give away any more information about distance or location, as they felt this might be a breach in privacy.
