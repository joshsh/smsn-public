@title "Thus, iBand users are handicapped at the same time are enabled in a different way with an “invented” gesture. Consequently, users lack a set of rules and conventions about how to use the new techno-gesture and must create these on their own as they use it. Through careful design, it may be possible for a wearable technology to enable an invented language of social gestures with its own affordances and constraints that have particular effects in certain kinds of social interactions. Such gestures might better support particular applications for which traditional gestures are felt to be inadequate."
