* :OoQeMx8qBT4JalSb: Sometimes we use words, and sometimes we don't, and both states are valid. And really it's more than "both" -- in the mind there is a whole spectrum of expression. Sometime we perceive objects, feelings, implications, or memories, without putting them into words. (Sometimes perception does not even get that far: we might detect aspects of something, without integrating the aspects into a "thing" to recognize.)
