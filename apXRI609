* :pXRI609: In addition to hard, quantifiable analytics, I see great value in softer, qualitative kinds of data -- a user's goals, moods, or puzzles, for instance. Daily, I taxonomize the world, and my own mind. I watch the borders shift between beliefs, values, preferences, goals and behaviors. Is patience a value or a habit? Is there a difference between a problem and an opportunity? Are faith and science oopposed, or is science something we have faith in? Using semantic networks to model the mind, and using graphs of a user's writing to learn about the user, is of great interest to me.
