* :sT9nGxf5cuTkaDSJ: "I see what a terrible mistake our society has made by criminalizing so much that young people do.  Activities that were once dismissed as pranks and 'kids being kids' are now prosecuted with vigor.  Fights between schoolchildren end up in court.  Fights between drunken college students send youths to jail.  Sure, those behaviors merit punishment, but in today's society the punishment is out of proportion to the action."
