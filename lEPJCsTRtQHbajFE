* :lEPJCsTRtQHbajFE: "While utilization TDs of about 0.5--l sec. were characteristic of the somatosensory system at cerebral levels, they were found to be very short (2-4 pulses) with stimuli applied to skin. The relatively long cerebral utilization TD leads to inferences about a latent period for conscious awareness of sensory input, at least at the near-threshold levels, which may have important general implications."
