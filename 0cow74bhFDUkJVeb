* :0cow74bhFDUkJVeb: (Ironically, while the *output* of writing is linear, the *process* of writing is not. Consider writers of fiction. Most do no't write the story from start to finish. They start with characters, or settings, or action sequences, and then try to connect them. They fill in gaps after reading it over. Sometimes scenes or even whole characters are discarded. A graph database allows an author to preserve and even analye that creative process.)
