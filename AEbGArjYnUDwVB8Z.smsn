@title once I got out from under the lower class B shelves, the flight to KRHV was uneventful. It was well after 22:00 when I reached the airspace, so the tower was closed (although the beacon was in operation) and I used the CTAF. I had to activate the pilot-controlled lighting as I entered the pattern. For the sake of night currency, I did one additional takeoff and landing to a full stop before taxiiing back to Aerodynamic.
