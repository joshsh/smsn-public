@title "At this point, one might ask which of the above criteria should apply to evaluating these claims regarding the automaticity of crossmodal correspondences. This is by no means a simple question to answer given the widely-publicised difficulty associated with any attempt to define automaticity and drawing a clear line between those processes that are automatic and those that are not (e.g., Bargh, 1992, 1994; Logan, 1985; MacLeod & Dunbar, 1988; Schneider, Dumais, & Shiffrin, 1984; Shiffrin, 1988; see Moors & De Houwer, 2006, for a review).
