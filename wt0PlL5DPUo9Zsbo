* :wt0PlL5DPUo9Zsbo: "Implicit connection based on context proximity means that artefacts will be automatically connected if their individual contexts are within certain proximity, depending on a suitable distance metric. For example, artefacts or devices worn by a person will experience similar context (e.g. same movement patterns) which could be used to establish a private body network that is not easily fooled to provide information access to other devices that may be detected near-by."
