@title if a file is in the SmSn multimedia repository, the metadata I have about it is a kind of guarantee that I have looked it over and made certain statements about its sharability, etc.  At the very least, I won't have marked embarrassing pictures of myself as public.  I can develop a habit whereby private data *not* in my repository becomes suspect, and is kept in an encrypted directory until it goes through the proper process.
