@title "The absence of qualia with substitute sight may be compared to the acquisition of a second language as an adult. The emotional aspects of the new language are often lacking, especially with emotionally charged words and expressions, such as curse words. It appears that both spoken language and other sensory messages require long experience within the context of other aspects of cultural and emotional development to be able to contain qualia."
