@title "It didn’t help that some corners of the counterculture actively, often gleefully, associated themselves with New Age religious movements and occultist iconography. During the height of the Vietnam War protests, for example (already an affront to conservatives), activist demonstrators associated with the Youth International Party, also known as the Yippies, led an exorcism designed to levitate the Pentagon (and also designed to be a good photo op). The Women’s International Terrorist Conspiracy from Hell, or WITCH, likewise played with occult themes to publicize its unabashedly feminist social justice agenda. Famously, on Halloween 1968, members of WITCH marched down Wall Street, hexing the stock market; they followed up the stunt with many other “guerrilla theater” efforts to curse the evil twins of capitalism and patriarchy."
