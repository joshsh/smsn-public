* :yccHNB74NjRlJgzn: [markdown]Semantic Synchrony uses fonts of different colors to indicate different sources for the notes. For instance, the notes from my personal graph are (mostly) yellow, while the notes from my public graph are (mostly) green. Initially, you probably won't care about the difference.
