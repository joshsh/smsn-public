@title "Answering the automaticity question turns out to be important not only when it comes to trying to distinguish crossmodal correspondences from canonical cases of synaesthesia, but also because it may help researchers to assess how crossmodal correspondences fit more generally into the framework of multisensory integration research (e.g., Bremner, Lewkowicz, & Spence, 2012; Calvert, Spence, & Stein, 2004; Stein, 2012). The idea that crossmodal correspondences may influence multisensory integration, and that their effect is, or at least can be, perceptual rather than necessarily just decisional (e.g., possibly reflecting some sort of response bias) in nature is a relatively recent one (see Gallace & Spence, 2006; Parise & Spence, 2009; Sweeny et al., 2012)."
