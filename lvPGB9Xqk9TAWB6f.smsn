@title General Renee Schneider was seen as the principal obstacle to the coup.  He felt that the Chilean armed forces take their oath only to the constitution, according to which Allende had been elected.  After the initial failed attempt to kidnap him, and subsequent CIA cables, he was gunned down in his car.  $35,000 was paid to one of the killers by the CIA after the killing.
