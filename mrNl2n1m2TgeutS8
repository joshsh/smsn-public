* :mrNl2n1m2TgeutS8: when you forget how you entered a particular item into Extend-o-Brain: what name you have given it, or where you have categorized it.  Or, when you can't remember whether some information you're looking for was added to the item in question, or another, related item.  Thus, there is extra work involved in retrieving that information or entering new information about the item, as well as a sense of wasted effort.
