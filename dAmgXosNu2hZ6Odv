* :dAmgXosNu2hZ6Odv: "In a natural habitat information is acquired continuously and simultaneously through the different sensory systems. As some of these inputs have the same distal source (such as the sight of a Â®re, but also the smell of smoke and the sensation of heat) it is reasonable to suppose that the organism should be able to bundle or bind information across sensory modalities and not only just within sensory modalities. For one such area where intermodal binding (IB) seems important, that of concurrently seeing and hearing affect, behavioural studies have shown that indeed intermodal binding takes place during perception [1-3]."
