@title "There are at least two ways in which to assess the non-conscious character of a given process: In a strong version, the non-conscious character comes from demonstrating that a process is pre-attentive. The mere presence of the stimulus (or target) is sufficient to start the process, while awareness of its presence is unnecessary. This can, for example, be tested by looking for pop-out effects in visual search paradigms (Mattingley, 2009; Treisman, 2005; Ward, Jonas, Dienes, & Seth, 2010; though see Mack & Rock, 1998). In a weaker version, at stake in a variety of tasks such as the IAT (Greenwald, McGhee, & Schwartz, 1998) and its variants (e.g., Demattè, Sanabria, & Spence, 2007; Parise & Spence, 2012; Peiffer-Smadja, 2010), all that is needed for a process to count as non-conscious is for it to occur without the participant’s conscious volition or control once the stimulus/target has been attended to (cf. Chen, Yeh, & Spence, 2011)."\u00E8, Sanabria, & Spence, 2007; Parise & Spence, 2012; Peiffer-Smadja, 2010), all that is needed for a process to count as non-conscious is for it to occur without the participant\u2019s conscious volition or control once the stimulus/target has been attended to (cf.
