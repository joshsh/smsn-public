* :P1cO5fPkpP1xDPS4: At its best, religion reaches for some amazing things -- things one can reasonably feel lucky to be regularly exposed to. Religion bundles them into a single authority figure, which can often be well trusted to give good advice. But the high things religion reaches for -- hope, love, judgement, compassion, faith, investigation, science -- yes, religion can be pro-science! -- surprise, coincidence, intuition, ... merit, trust, belief, faith, tradition
