One way: First retune from equal tempered to a dense set of just ratios, for no human-perceptible change in pitch.
Next define inharmonicity as (a linear function of?) two components:
  the product of the ratio of every pair of frequencies
  the deviation in each freq from where it started
and minimize
```
