* :n9pAptsyZKpDGxc9: capitalists sometimes object to the idea of liberalism by claiming that people would not choose to work if they didn't have to.  According to Chomsky, this is contrary to human nature: given the right conditions, people choose to work.  Self-directed, creative work is one of the highest ideals to aspire to.  This is contrary to the idea of work which comes out of capitalist ideology, which is that people have to be driven to work.
