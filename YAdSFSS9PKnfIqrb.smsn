I found this in the paper on higher order Prolog.

filter(_P, [], []).
filter(P, [A0|As0], As) :- ( call(P, A0) -> As = [A0|As1];
                                            As = As1
                           ),
                           filter(P, As0, As1).

gt3(X) :- X > 3. % use to test filter
```
