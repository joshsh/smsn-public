* :ppzsIi2: the practice is attributed to a popular myth. However, in esoteric Hinduism, Ganesha represents the lowermost chakra (energy centre) called the Muladhara that resides in the abdomen. A person's spiritual journey is said to begin when the "kundalini shakti" or the creative power, starts to rise from the Muladhara chakra. Hence, all pujas start with venerating Ganesha
