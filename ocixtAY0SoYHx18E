* :ocixtAY0SoYHx18E: "I am a PhD student in Computer Science in the Tetherless World Constellation, as well as a very active software developer. My interests center on real-time semantics, RDF streams and graph databases. I am the creator of the Ripple scripting language, the TwitLogic semantic microblogging utility, and the RDFAgents protocol. I also co-founded the TinkerPop graph database group, where I contribute tools which bridge the gap between the Semantic Web and NoSQL databases. My work has been featured in ReadWriteWeb and New Scientist. Please check out my Slideshare presentations, my GitHub page, or my personal homepage for more details."
