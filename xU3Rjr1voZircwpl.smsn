@title when I enter a quotation by Socrates under some other topic, I wish it were a quicker process to add the quotation to a list of quotations by Socrates.  It is easy to do manually, but it is not quite worth the time.  On the other hand, not doing so leads to lots of notes which are not linked as well as they could be, which leads to wasted or duplicated effort.
