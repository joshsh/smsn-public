@title "As part of a larger body of work aimed at real-time assistance with reading faces in conversation, this thesis develops a video test to evaluate the understanding of real-life social cues by autistic individuals as compared to typically developing individuals. The development of this video test involves collecting videos in real-life situations, manually dividing the videos by social cue content, labeling the resulting video clips, and sorting the video clips by difficulty."
