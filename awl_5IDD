* :wl_5IDD: the power of the US president as "decider" runs contrary to the Constitution, in which decisions are made through compromises between three equal components.  If you can't make a compromise, then your views do not prevail.  As many US justices have said, this was never intended to make things more efficient; it was intended as a bulwark against tyranny.
