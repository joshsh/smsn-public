* :eaamhNngOPutbPC6: Imagine a team of mathematicians working to understand a collection of papers. They can mark passages "interesting" and "boring", and thereby help each other choose what to review. Later, a team of computer scientists studying the same papers might expand the labels to "interesting to a mathematician", "interesting to a computer scientist", etc. And that feedback might help the original authors understand how to communicate effectively (to who).
