* :Oj-J-Ym: "In both auditory and cutaneous stimulation manipulation of the intensity relationship between the 1st and delayed stimulus produced large changes in thresholds. As the delayed stimulus was attenuated from 0-15 db. the threshold rapidly increased, but when the 1st stimulus was attenuated from 0-20 db. the threshold decreased slightly at 5-10 db. and then began to increase gradually."
