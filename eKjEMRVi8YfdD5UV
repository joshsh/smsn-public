* :eKjEMRVi8YfdD5UV: In contrast to a traditional table of contents or filesystem, the notes in the graph can, by having multiple parents, effectively "be" in more than one "place" at once. Whereas in a traditional filesystem, files can become so far apart that they get lost, in a graph, any two things that should be neighbors can be neighbors, forever ever. There is no red shift, no rule of entropy, no universal expansion ripping the data apart.
