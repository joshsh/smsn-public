* :6NJs0ah: "However, a number of more recent studies have reported some emotional modulations for the amplitude of the N170 (see Ashley, Vuilleumier, & Swick, 2004; Batty & Taylor, 2003; Campanella, Quinet, Bruyer, Crommelinck, & Guerit, 2002; Eger, Jedynak, Iwaki, & Skrandies, 2003; Miyoshi, Katayama, & Morotomi, 2004; Pizzagalli et al., 2002). These emotional effects on N170 do not appear selective for any specific expression, since they were found for fearful (Campanella, Quinet et al., 2002) as well as disgust and happiness (Ashley et al., 2004), and also vary with face orientation (Ashley et al., 2004), perhaps suggesting a role of non-specific configural and attentional effects associated with encoding of structural facial cues, rather than with emotional significance per se (see Ashley et al., 2004; Ioannides, Liu, Kwapien, Drozdz, & Streit, 2000)."
