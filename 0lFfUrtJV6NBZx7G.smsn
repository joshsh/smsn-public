Red cut: Here, if Prolog finds that X in fact is =< Y, it should never then try to satisfy the clause in which X > Y. Hnece the !.
   
max(X,Y,Z)  :-  X  =<  Y,!,  Y  =  Z.   
max(X,Y,X).   

Green cut: Below is a slower way to achieve the same thing -- slower because if it reaches the second branch, it runs two comparisons.

max(X,Y,Y)  :-  X  =<  Y,!.   
max(X,Y,X)  :-  X>Y.
```
