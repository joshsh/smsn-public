* :6v3eDvGwpm3vfLDB: an experiment to verify CMF has been proposed, but a suitable test subject has yet to be found.  The experiment demands that a section of cerebral cortex be excised while still supported by the circulatory system, then stimulated electrically.  If the test subject reports a subjective experience, then a cortical area can contribute to a "conscious field", even in the absence of neuronal connections.
