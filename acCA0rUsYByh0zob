The perceived timing of a visual event is attracted toward other events in audition and touch, provided that the lag between them is below ~200 msec. It implies that, in cross-modal SJ or TOJ tasks, where stimuli are typically presented at these short SOAs, there may always be a mutual attraction between the senses due to temporal ventriloquism."
