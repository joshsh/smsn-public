@title "Here, we ask whether such a mapping between two arbitrary sensory signals from vision and touch can be learned from their statistical co-occurrence such that they become integrated. [...] To this end, we trained subjects with stimuli that are usually unrelated in the worldâ€”the luminance of an object (visual signal) and its stiffness (haptic signal). [...] We found a significant change in discrimination performance before and after training when comparing trials with congruent and incongruent stimuli. After training, discrimination thresholds for the incongruent stimuli are increased relative to thresholds for congruent stimuli, suggesting that subjects learned effectively to integrate the two formerly unrelated signals."
