@title Part of my enthusiasm for the Semantic Web comes from the economic research experience. Every data set, though "just" a grid of numbers, was a uniquely labor intensive object. The codebook is separate from the data, and they easily fall out of sync. The amount of effort we duplicated -- learning how to interpret each new data set, devising integrity tests to accommodate its idiosyncracies, re-creating the kinds of tables we preferred from the tables we had -- was staggering. Researchers I know in other fields face similar problems.
