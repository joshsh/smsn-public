@title from here until the switch to IdIndexGraph, Brain-mode used a Blueprints branch which allowed the value of a designated property (here, "key") to be used instead of the id (formerly an integer which would be different on each load).  This was the first dump which could have been re-imported to Neo4j and then exported again with an empty diff.
