@title I have found two of my drawings in the book; the one on page 44 which I found through the index, and the one I recognized while flipping through the book (the same one which Anne-Marie emailed me about). I didn't recognize the one on page 44, but it definitely looks like one of mine; I had similar drawings on my wall, vaguely reminiscent of strange attractors like the Lorenz Attractor
