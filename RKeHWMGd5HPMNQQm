* :RKeHWMGd5HPMNQQm: I never saw Merlin's answer, and I assumed my question had not been selected for inclusion in the column.  However, on 2013-10-03 I found (an edited, more concise version of) the question and an answer online as a result of an ego search on Google.  I still don't know whether it ever appeared in the magazine, but it does appear in a book, Just Visiting This Planet, published in 1998.  The question as it has been rephrased isn't quite what I was getting at... I was really asking whether a magnet which opposes a force such as gravity is doing work and will lose its magnetism as a result, not whether the attraction between two magnets, in itself, will cause magnets to lose their magnetism.  Nonetheless, it is fun to see a response to my question after all of these years.
