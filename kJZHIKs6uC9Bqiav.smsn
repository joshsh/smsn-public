Buy fresh beets. cut tops off if they have any (can be cooked as greens).  Wash and scrub with vegetable brush (the brush by the sink)
boil for an hr or so (time depends on size), until tender with fork.  take out of liquid and let cool. (save liquid) slip skins off with fingers under running water. chop up and put in jar, cover with lovely deep purple liquid they boiled in.  add some vinegar to taste (not much), and some fresh chopped onion if you like.  The beets are naturally very sweet, so adding vinegar makes a pleasant sweet/sour combo.  :-)
