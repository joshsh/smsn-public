* :QkUH77TtduEPUSYb: [markdown]The two most commonly used views are forward-view and backward-view. Both of them presume some `root` note, which could be thought of as the view's focus, or center. In forward-view, the root's children are visible. The root is a note, and so are the children, but whereas the children are in the buffer, the root is only visible as the title of the buffer.
