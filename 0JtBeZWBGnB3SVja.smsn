URI includes URN and URL.
IRI = URI expanded("internationalized") from ascii to unicode

URL specifies via "how to find it".
  It looks like an address but it's not really;
  "HTTP name lookup is a complex, powerful and evolving set of standards"
URN encompasses, e.g., ISBN numbers.
  "The URN for that edition would be urn:ISBN0-486-27557-4"
```
