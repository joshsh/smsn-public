* :N9icR0Qp3N55c9EM: "Here, following the framework exposed in Spence and Deroy (in press), I show that crossmodal correspondences can also play two others [sic] roles, that is in crossmodal completion and in crossmodal imagery. As such, crossmodal correspondences can explain phenomena such as silent-lip reading or certain aspects of musical imagery that other models want to attribute either to ubiquituous synaesthetic effects (Ward, 2011) or emotional congruence (Palmer et al., 2011)."
