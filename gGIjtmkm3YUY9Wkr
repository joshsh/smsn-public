@title as described by Seth Godin, the paradox is as follows.  There are two urns, one of which has an equal number of black and brown balls, and one of which has an unknown number of black balls and an unknown number of brown balls.  Your goal is to draw a black ball.  Which urn do you choose?  Most people choose the first urn, because at least then, your odds are known.
