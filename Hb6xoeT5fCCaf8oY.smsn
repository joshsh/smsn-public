@title the lid of the Klavier has been detached for years. I do not remember why I took it off, though it may have to do with the fact that with the lid attached, the keyboard cover would not close properly; it would bump up against the case. At any rate, all of the screws (minus one, for which I substituted a similar screw) were still in a baggie with my clavichorch materials. I simply reattached the lid and, discovering the issue with the keyboard cover, sawed a thin strip of wood off of the protruding edge of the cover with my dremel. It looks fine, and closes nicely now. As a next step, I need to make a new cap for the box to the left of the keyboard; I seem to have lost this at some point. I also need to run a string between the lid and the case to keep the lid from overextending.
