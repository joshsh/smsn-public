@title Herb’s right that the sentences and grammar that Nim produced were not spoken or written English grammar, or syntax for that matter.  But the reality is that neither is American Sign Language [ASL] when it’s spoken by a native signer.  Syntax and grammar in ASL is completely different than syntax and grammar in spoken and written English. Herb might be accurate in that narrow sense of his data, and in his failure to actually even attempt to teach grammar or sentences.  I’ve read all his stuff; I didn’t see any real concerted effort to bring in native signers.  He didn’t consult the sign language community.  There’s some more arrogance for you.\u2019s right that the sentences and grammar that Nim produced were not spoken or written English grammar, or syntax for that matter.
