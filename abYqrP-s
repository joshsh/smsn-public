* :bYqrP-s: peripherally we may become aware that something is not quite right, as when awkward sentences leave a reader tired and discomforted without knowing why.  By moving sentence construction from periphery to center we are empowered to act, either by finding better literature or accepting the source of unease and continuing.  Without centering the periphery might be a source of frantic following of fashion; with centering the periphery is a fundamental enabler of calm through increased awareness and power.
