* :MuXMILqUkGrw9PAw: "In this paper, we analyze the trade-off between power consumption and prediction accuracy of context classifiers working on dual-axis accelerometer data collected from the eWatch sensing and notification platform. We improve power consumption techniques by providing competitive classification performance even in the low frequency region of 1-10 Hz and for the highly erratic wrist based sensing location."
