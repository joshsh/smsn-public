To numerically evaluate an expression with a Symbol at a point, we might use subs followed by evalf, but it is more efficient and numerically stable to pass the substitution to evalf using the subs flag, which takes a dictionary of Symbol: point pairs.

>>> expr = cos(2*x)
>>> expr.evalf(subs={x: 2.4})
0.0874989834394464
```
