@title "One-way of looking at these differences is to ask about their underlying computations. The key feature in multisensory integration is that the multisensory response is significantly different (e.g. larger, smaller) from the best component response. An integrated multisensory response may be identified by the inequality [(C1C2) not â‰  max(C1, C2)], where C1C2 refers to the actual multisensory response that is recorded, and C1 and C2 refer to the presumptive individual component responses (determined in separate or interleaved tests by presenting the modality-specific stimuli individually). In the case of cross-modal matching, the operation may be described as an evaluation of the equality [C1 = C2]. Both processes are critical features of normal brain function but do not share the same computational platform and could have very different developmental time courses."\u2260 max(C1, C2)], where C1C2 refers to the actual multisensory response that is recorded, and C1 and C2 refer to the presumptive individual component responses (determined in separate or interleaved tests by presenting the modality-specific stimuli individually).
