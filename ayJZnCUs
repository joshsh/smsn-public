* :yJZnCUs: If a man presents the most precious gifts in the world to his fellow, but with a sullen and downcast countenance, Scripture regards that man as though he presented nothing at all to his fellow.  On the other hand, he who receives his fellow with a cheerful countenance, even if he gives him nothing -- Scripture accounts it to him as though he had presented his fellow with the most precious gifts in the world.
