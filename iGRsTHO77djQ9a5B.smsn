@title "The question is whether these putative spatial and temporal windows of integration are the same for spatial and temporal ventriloquism. From the literature, it appears that they are quite different. For spatial ventriloquism, several behavioral and physiological studies have shown that the spatial ventriloquist effect disappears when the audiovisual temporal alignment is outside a −100 –+300 ms window (−100 ms=sound before vision; +300 ms=sound after vision), while the horizontal spatial alignment should not exceed ~15° (Godfroy et al., 2003; Hairston, Wallace, Vaughan, Stein, Norris & Schirillo, 2003; Lewald & Guski, 2003; Slutsky & Recanzone, 2001; Radeau & Bertelson, 1977), although the specific degree of tolerated disparities could take a wide range (Wallace, Roberson, Hairston, Stein, Vaughan & Schirillo, 2004)."
