* :aP1HQkB: "When a person looks at an object while exploring it with their hand, vision and touch both provide information for estimating the properties of the object. Vision frequently dominates the integrated visualâ€“haptic percept, for example when judging size, shape or position1, 2, 3, but in some circumstances the percept is clearly affected by haptics4, 5, 6, 7. Here we propose that a general principle, which minimizes variance in the final estimate, determines the degree to which vision or haptics dominates."
