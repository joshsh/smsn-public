* :JrthwkfipymhghdN: "Intelligent agents were a cornerstone of the early Semantic Web vision, gathering and digesting information from diverse sources, networking with other agents, and acting as personal gateways to the vast wilderness of Semantic Web data which would surely emerge. Fast-forward one decade to the present day, and those large bodies of data do exist as RDFa, Linked Data, and SPARQL-accessible triple stores... but where are all the agents? With the rise of real-time services, Semantic Web agents may soon come into their own. Agent communication provides a versatile, standard framework for real-time information exchange which is to the various social streaming APIs as RDF is to their individual JSON- and XML-based data formats. This session will discuss emerging use cases and technologies for weaving Semantic Web agents into the real-time Web, including semantic microblogging and instant messaging, event-driven RDF data streams, peer-to-peer semantic information discovery, and the FIPA-based RDFAgents protocol."
