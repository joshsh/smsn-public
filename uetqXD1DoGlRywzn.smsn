@title "It was originally Brecher [19] who reported that very short temporal periods, in vision on average 57 ms, represent what he termed units of subjective time. Events falling within this time window would be perceived as simultaneous even if they were physically asynchronous; whereas events falling within two different units of subjective time would be perceived as asynchronous."
