* :WbvWC3gIaIuK2BGs: You always choose what to read when. To some extent even within a choice of what to read, often you skip around. You might sometimes construct for yourself a feeling of being guided by the words, but ultimately reading is choice. To fully recognize and efficiently use those choices could be called "creative reading".
