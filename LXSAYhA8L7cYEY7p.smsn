#!/bin/bash

#  Surprisingly, nested colons are not a problem for this.
#  They need not be present on the argument (if it includes no whitespace)
#  on the command line, and if they are present, they appear to get stripped
# off before being placed in the quotation marks below.

grep "$1" -r . --include \*.hs --include \*.md --include \*.txt
```
