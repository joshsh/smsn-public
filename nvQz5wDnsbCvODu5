* :nvQz5wDnsbCvODu5: "Now where might the crossmodal correspondence between pitch and lightness have been learned? In most natural environments, the source of illumination comes from above. Humans and presumably many other species (e.g., chimps) have been shown to internalize such information in terms of a “light-from-above” prior (Adams, Graf, & Ernst, 2004). Add to this the fact that smaller bodies or objects will, generally-speaking, make higher-pitched sounds when struck, sounded, voiced etc. than larger objects, and further that smaller objects are more likely to be found in the sky than large objects (elephants and whales were presumably never going to fly). The suggestion that emerges is that there may indeed be an environmental association between lightness, pitch and size: Smaller higher-pitched objects are, statistically-speaking more likely to be located somewhat closer to the source of ambient illumination and hence to be better illuminated and appear visually lighter than larger objects."
