* :UvbVKwPtyVFhB2QF: "Context proximity as a paradigm for connecting artefacts is of particular interest in our project, as artefacts enabled with Smart-Its have built-in context awareness. Context in Smart-Its generally refers to information about the system environment obtained through sensors. Context comprises raw sensor data, generic percepts extracted from sensors, and artefact- or application-specific information resulting from further abstraction. Hence, Smart-Its are near to each other in terms of context proximity when they experience similar situations or conditions."
