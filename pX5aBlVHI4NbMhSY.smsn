@title one useful method is to go through your text with a highlighter, highlighting any words or phrases which would not be familiar to the average person on the street.  This is particularly useful for your first page, and especially for the first paragraph, where first impressions count.  An alternative is to delete any sentences which fail this test and see what is left.
