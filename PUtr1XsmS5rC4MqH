* :PUtr1XsmS5rC4MqH: "Bernieri et alâ€™s research also suggests that there is a disconnect between how rapport is encoded, and observers decode rapport from nonverbal signals, with observers judging the amount of rapport present in a social interaction based on the expressivity of individuals, i.e. the amount an individual talks, smiles, and uses expressive facial expressions and gestures. They conclude that this expressivity of individuals drives social judgments, even though rapport is actually encoded through much richer and diverse nonverbal signals."
