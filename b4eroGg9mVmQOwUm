* :b4eroGg9mVmQOwUm: e.g. when I attended Prof. H's lecture on Aaron Swartz, instead of making a new note for Aaron, I search and copy a reference to Aaron from earlier notes.  This allows me, in future, to look backwards from Aaron to all of the notes I have taken which reference him, as well as to accumulate information about him (forward links) over time
