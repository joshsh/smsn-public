* :D4hnJoA9KCiKdLXq: A note can have an `alias`, or URL, associated with it. From such a note in SmSn, the user can open the alias in their browser by pressing `C-c C-a C-t b`. Moreover, if they have the SmSn Chrome Plugin installed, from a page in Chrome they can create a note formatted for SmSn, with an alias and a human-readable text field.
