* :wZi_Raz: "We will not claim to be able to provide a clear definition. However, if we talk about a ‘cue’ we think of it as any information that gives rise to a sensory estimate. Compared with  common understanding, this view omits the assumption that cues have to be somehow ‘independent modules’. For the purpose of this article, to get around the problem of definition of a ‘cue’ we have divided cue combination into two parts that we refer to as ‘sensory combination’ and ‘sensory integration’."
