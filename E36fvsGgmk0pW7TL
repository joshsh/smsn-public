* :E36fvsGgmk0pW7TL: the results, while unreliable for individual values, are in fact significant when considered in aggregate, e.g. on a time scale of days as I have done here.  When doing so, it is important to keep in mind the standard deviation, which can be quite high, as well as the mean of tm.plugin.sentiment's "polarity" for a given set of atom values.  Even ignoring standard deviation, however, it is possible to pick out broad trends.  For example, there is a peak of overall positive sentiment lasting almost two weeks between 2014-10-15 and 2014-10-28 beginning in my "week of acceptance", extending through my "week of accountability" and ending in my more difficult "week of agreeableness".  This was indeed a period full of material on virtue and other positive concepts.  Likewise, the brief trough of negative sentiment which follows it corresponds directly to the day of 2014-10-28 during which I was making extensive notes about guilt.  I have learned from this analysis that while not inaccurate, the detected sentiment is only indirectly related to my mood on a given day; it really has to do with the topics of the day, which may or may not have been influenced by mood.
