* :LwQEcmoBfm0JNg4U: [markdown]If you are in a public place and don't want your private notes visible, you can set a minimum sharability level (`C-c C-s C-m [nubmer]`). (The minimum sharability must be at least the sharability of the root of the current view, though; otherwise you would not be permitting yourself to see anything.)
