* :Z1aLqFtsYq93z3PQ: When an adult has undiagnosed SPD, he or she might not know what is wrong. They might buy into the hypothesis that theyâ€™re merely strange and not seek treatment. Others might withdraw from society where they are inundated with lights, sounds, or sensations that are overwhelming or painful. Some people with SPD learn to adapt and find ways to hide their difficulties.
