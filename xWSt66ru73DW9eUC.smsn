@title another thing of importance is how the material is prepared. As is the case with most commercial systems, the user wishes to run the plant material moist without drying. This is why a lot of the extracts when first removed are pretty much all liquid. This can be a result of bad CO2 as well because the lower grades have higher allowable moisture contents. It is my opinion that this hasty preparation is what causes the common leafy taste that is associated with the large system's extracts
