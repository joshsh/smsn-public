Jesus, Russ. This isn't just an engineering problem. Sure, you could kill any humans crossing the border at undesignated spots, With drones, for cheap. But America needs to work with the world. That's the way we became the wealthiest country on earth: Cooperation. America is already losing face, fast -- we look mean and stupid. Britain's parliament refused to meet the president. Mexico could hurt a lot of Americans by merely getting its corn from elsewhere -- we sell 25% of our corn to them[1].

It is possible to isolate a country from the world -- North Korea does it. But it is not possible to do so comfortably.
