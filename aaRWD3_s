* :aRWD3_s: "On the basis of these findings, some have concluded that speech is special (van Wassenhove et  2007; Vatakis, Ghazanfar, & Spence, 2008) or that, when stimulus complexity increases, sensitivity for temporal order deteriorates (Vatakis & Spence, 2006). It seems, however, that stimulus factors, such as rise time, need to be controlled more carefully before any sensible comparison can be made across audioâ€“visual speech, complex stimuli, and simple combinations of flashes and beeps."
