@title "The original evidence that prompted researchers to make the automaticity claim came from the many speeded classification studies demonstrating that the speeded discrimination of target stimuli in one modality (e.g., discriminating larger vs. smaller circles, for visual stimuli presented on a monitor) was affected by the presentation of a completely task-irrelevant auditory stimulus that varied randomly on a trial-by-trial basis between high and low pitch (see Marks, 2004; Spence, 2011, for reviews). However, the suggested automaticity of crossmodal correspondences has been questioned by a series of negative results from studies that have sometimes failed to show any difference in behaviour between those conditions in which congruent vs. incongruent pairs of visual and auditory stimuli have been presented (see also Chiou & Rich, 2012a; Heron et al., 2012; Klapetek, Ngo, & Spence, 2012; Klein, Brennan, D’Aloisio, D’Entremont, & Gilani, 1987; Klein, Brennan, & Gilani, 1987; Sweeny, Guzman-Martinez, Ortega, Grabowecky, & Suzuki, 2012)."
