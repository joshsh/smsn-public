@title alignment with Wikipedia helps me to search for concepts by giving them unique, authoritative names.  If I know the Wikipedia name for a concept, and I can't find it in TinkerNotes with a search, either I have not taken notes about the concept yet, or I have not aligned it with Wikipedia as I should have.  I don't have to search on more than one term, wondering what I called the concept at the time I took the notes.
