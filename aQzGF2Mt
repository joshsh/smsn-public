* :QzGF2Mt: "Where do these “vertically integrated” skills fit in our models of the mind? Here, we need to point at a relatively poor philosophical literature when it comes to thinking about the status of semi-perceptual, semi-cognitive skills such as reading, and their relation to more canonical forms of perception. Many philosophical questions remain open. Does reading simply consist in seeing letters? What is then the difference between seeing a letter and seeing a shape? If reading is an access to meaningful words, what is the difference between words and “common sensibles” for instance, shared both by audition, vision, and eventually touch? Addressing these questions for reading, we contend, is not only intrinsically important but likely to offer a parallel to build better models of sensory substitution."
