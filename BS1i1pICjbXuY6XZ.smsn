@title "It is unbecoming for a host to eat in his guest's presence without asking the guest to join him.  It is more unbecoming for a guest to invite another guest.  It is even more unbecoming to eat in the presence of a discible of the wise without inviting him to join.  More unbecoming that these three is for a guest to cause trouble to his host."
