It's easy for someone who's got a lot of rich friends to try business ideas until one of them succeeds, and then tell you about how easy that (selected success, out of many unreported failures) was. Finding a house that turned out to be a bargain is hard; people get fooled, buy things that end up costing more than they make. The cost of the house and the gain from renters are both unpredictable.

If someone acts able to predict the housing market, they might believe it themselves. Disabusing them of it is at most sometimes a good opportunity, and when that, delicate.
