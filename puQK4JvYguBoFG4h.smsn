@title "According to the fourth and final criterion, the speed criterion, a process is more likely to be automatic if it can be demonstrated that it affects the very earliest stages of information processing. Hackley (1993), for example, suggests that information processing is strongly automatic until 15 ms for audition and about 80 ms for vision (see Moors & De Houwer, 2006, for further discussion of this criterion)."
