@title "Here, we combined event-related fMRI techniques with an olfactory detection task (Figure 1) to characterize olfactory-visual integration in the human brain. Odors and pictures were presented either independently (unimodal) or in combination (bimodal). During bimodal conditions, the odor-picture pairs could be either semantically related or unrelated."
