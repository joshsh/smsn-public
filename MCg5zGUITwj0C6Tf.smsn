@title [markdown]Knowledge graphs in this way resemble the internet. However, they offer features the internet does not. From a passage in a knowledge graph, one has immediate access not just to the things it links to, but the things that link to it. Many people can edit the same knowledge graph, without getting in each others' way: If, in reading about a film, you want to include Syskel and Eberts' comments about the film, but not your crazy uncle's, you can do that.
