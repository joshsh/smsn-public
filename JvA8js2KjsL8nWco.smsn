@title unfortunately, it is prohibitively expensive. I submitted a simple model (an approximation of key 22 without the keytop) to Shapeways and Sculpteo. For the cheapest available printing options, the model came out at $25 at Shapeways and $35 at Sculpteo. I could bring the price down somewhat by hollowing out the key, which is desirable from a design point of view anyway, but even if the price were $10 per key, that's almost $500 for a full keyboard.
