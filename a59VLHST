* :59VLHST: "Users can now simply take two devices they wish to connect and move them together, for instance holding them in the hand, briefly waving or shaking. This imposes the same movement pattern on the devices. In all likelihood, this pattern will be different from that measured at the same time in other Smart-Its in the vicinity, ruling out unintended connection."
