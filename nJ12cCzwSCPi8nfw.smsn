@title [markdown][Semantic Synchrony]() is an open-source (free) knowledge graph editor. A knowledge graph is what lets Google, Siri, WolframAlpha, probably the CIA, and others answer questions about the world. However, unlike those systems, Semantic Synchrony is easy to use -- much easier than Microsoft Word or Minecraft -- and more general.
