Ordinary living is impressive. A top-functioning human is a special equilibrium. Spending the right time with the right person, maybe even while eating the right thing, is the kind of ?detail that separates 99th percentile performance from 99.9th (where the relevant population is something like all of our ancestors, including the dumbest suicidal fish).

Be not tempted to skip {a healthy breakfast,}. Recognize that the quality of your decisions later in the day depends (at least in worthwhile part) on such things.
