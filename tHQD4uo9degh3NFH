* :tHQD4uo9degh3NFH: [markdown]* The easiest way: Use the online graph. This way you don't have to run the server. Just install Emacs, then install smsn-mode for Emacs, then use the shared graph hosted at fortytwo.net. (You can download ("export") a copy of the data if you want.) To install this way, skip to step 6 (Install Emacs). Note that the online graph uses the master branch of smsn, so you'll need to use the master branch of smsn-mode to access it.
