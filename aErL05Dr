* :ErL05Dr: the ship "Tomorrow" which rescues Kee (perhaps Theo, and perhaps humanity) at the very end of the film is like the prince who saves a princess from certain death at the end of a fairy tale.  The movie never gives you a single reason to hope for a happy ending, and yet there it is, the light at the end of the tunnel.  A bit like the very non-dark ending of Dark City.
