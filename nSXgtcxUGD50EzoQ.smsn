@title from attrigh: "I quite like the ability to visualise the entire tree structure in one buffer in org-mode (which is a reason why I strongly prefer it to something which is pure hypertext), including all ancestors of a node. You seem to support showing children quite well. And I guess you could get a similar behaviour to an org file by just having a node that represents the org file with all of the file's root nodes as children of this node."
