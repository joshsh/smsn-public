@title "We present a service-oriented context-aware middleware (SOCAM) architecture for the building and rapid prototyping of context-aware mobile services. We propose an ontology-based approach to model various contexts. Our context model supports semantic representation, context reasoning and context knowledge sharing. We take a service-oriented approach to build our middleware which supports tasks including acquiring, discovering, interpreting, accessing various contexts and interoperability between different context-aware systems."
