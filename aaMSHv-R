* :aMSHv-R: a user instructs her Semantic Web agent, via her handheld Web browser, to find an appropriate health care provider for her mother and set up an appointment.  The agent takes into account the patient's medical needs and geographic constraints, the busy schedules of her two children, and the ratings and appointment times of available providers.  Settling on an appointment plan is an iterative process which is coordinated among several agents and two people.
