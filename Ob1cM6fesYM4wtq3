* :Ob1cM6fesYM4wtq3: "Reading does not constitute an independent visual road substituting for the auditory perception of spoken language. More importantly, it is not an autonomous or dedicated perceptual system, and it is well explained as the development of a second route, grafted onto the auditory speech route, as popularized by the dual-route models of reading (e.g., Coltheart and Rastle, 1994; see also Rastle, 2007 for a review on current models of visual word recognition)."
