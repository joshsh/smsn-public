@title on 2017-10-01, I used the Synchronometer to test the rise and fall time of the laser card module. However, the sensitivity of the test is limited by the long rise and fall times of the photoresistor taking the measurements. I determined that the latency of the laser card module is less than or equal to that of the photoresistor, with a rise to 50% time of less than 12 ms and a fall to 50% time of less than 8 ms.
