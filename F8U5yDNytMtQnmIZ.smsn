If you ask s(X,Y), it will find:
  s(11,11)
  s(1,y) for y in [1,3]
  s(0,0)
In the rule for q(X,Y), it is committed to the first value it took, 1, so it never finds q(x,_) for x > 1. And since ! commits to that branch of q, it never finds q(22,22) either.

--

s(X,Y):-  q(X,Y).   
s(0,0).

q(11,11).
q(X,Y):-  i(X),  !, j(Y).
q(22,22).
   
i(1).   i(2).
j(1).   j(2).  j(3).
```
