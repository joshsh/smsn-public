@title this lesson wasn't as enjoyable as most, but I did learn quite a bit. The topic was emergency landing procedures. The CFI was uncharacteristically grumpy and impatient today, and deprived me of some important PIC time, including most of the radio calls as well as the entire approach and landing. Despite his overly critical comments, I succeeded at all three simulated emergency landings by arriving at final approach for the chosen landing site with the right vector and speed. Our practice area today was the San Antonio Reservoir, and the scenery was breathtaking. I had a bit more time to enjoy the scenery today, thanks to a series of long climbs uninterrupted by any chit-chat with the CFI. However, I should have been taking the time to practice scanning for traffic, as we experienced a loss of separation from an airplane flying right past us in the opposite direction, coming within perhaps 200-300 feet. One wonders how they didn't see us, but we should equally well have seen them. I experienced the difference between a climbing spiral to the left (preferred) and to the right (non-preferred for right-of-way reasons and also because you end up fighting the p-factor), and I gained the valuable skill of immediately trimming for best glide speed, maneuvering above a landing site, then slipping aggressively to get down. I was able to record most of the flight, and will review the recording before next lesson.
