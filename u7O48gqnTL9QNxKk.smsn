@title "For example, the perception of audio-visual synchrony and cross-modal equivalence of intensity, which does not require the extraction of complex cross-modal relations, has been shown to be present at birth or shortly thereafter (Lewkowicz & Turkewitz, 1980, 1981; Lewkowicz et al., 2010), whereas the perception of higher-level amodal relations, such as affect or gender, emerges many months later (Walker-Andrews, 1986; Patterson & Werker, 2002)"
