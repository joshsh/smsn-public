Sometimes it knows:

    10 ?- X in 0..10, Y in 11..20,zcompare(C, X, Y).
    C = (<),
    X in 0..10,
    Y in 11..20.
    
Sometimes it can't:
    
    11 ?- X in 0..11, Y in 11..20,zcompare(C, X, Y).
    X in 0..11,
    zcompare(C, X, Y),
    freeze(C, clpfd:zcompare_(C, X, Y)),
    Y in 11..20.
```
