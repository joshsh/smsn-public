* :FPqhewv: "Nalani Ambady and Robert Rosenthal [13] have shown that observers can accurately classify human attitudes (such as interest) from non-verbal behavior using observations as short as six seconds. The accuracy of such “thin slice” classifications are typically around 70%, corresponding to a correlation between observer prediction and measured response of about r = 0.40. initial experiments using a range of motion and sound  indicate that it is possible for computers to duplicate this human perceptual ability [14, 15]. We therefore set out to measure human interest levels and affiliations using the sensors and computation capacity of our badge platforms."
