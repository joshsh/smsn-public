* :CxWRwgphpYIJMsUg: "In these approaches, sensors can be attached to an actor under observation—namely wearable sensors or smart phones, or objects that constitute the activity environment— namely dense sensing. Wearable sensors often use inertial measurement units and radio frequency identification (RFID) tags to gather an actor’s behavioral information. This approach is effective to recognize physical movements such as physical exercises. In contrast, dense sensing infers activities by monitoring human–object interactions through the usage of multiple multimodal miniaturized sensors."
