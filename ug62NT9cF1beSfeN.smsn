@title I would like to use my laptop for experiments in multisensory processing. It would be nice to use Processing for these experiments. Unfortunately, the video output for a simple Processing sketch seems to lag the auditory output by around 50 milliseconds. I used a circuit I had built with Arduino to measure the difference between a threshold response to light and a threshold response to sound, and found the 50 ms delay. The delay is perhaps a couple of milliseconds less when the graphics are drawn after the sine wave audio is cued, but this doesn't make enough of a difference. 50 milliseconds is far too much lag for these kinds of experiments.
