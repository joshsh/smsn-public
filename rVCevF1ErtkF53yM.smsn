@title [markdown]Process an idea until it is done, rewriting it and connecting it to others. Then zoom out, consider the mandala of surrounding expressions. Whatever the previous focus was, the mind can now wander across a convenient list of its neighbors. Or jump to something farther away in the graph, using text search. Or ignore the recorded data altogether, returning to inner stillness.
