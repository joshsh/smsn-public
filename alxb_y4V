* :lxb_y4V: "[...] mathematical ideas originate in empirics, [...]. But, once they are so conceived, the subject begins to live a peculiar life of its own and is better compared to a creative one, governed by almost entirely aesthetical motivations, [...]. As a mathematical discipline travels [...] after much "abstract" inbreeding, [it] is in danger of degeneration. [...] whenever this stage is reached, the only remedy seems to me to be the rejuvenating return to the source: the re-injection of more or less directly empirical ideas."
