There are (at least) two kinds of meditation.

One is creative, the mind wandering freely.

The other is focused. In general the focus is a task. It can also be a talisman with no purpose, like a candle flame. Task-focus is I daresay more useful, but it requires more discipline to keep the mind quiet when there is purpose at hand.
