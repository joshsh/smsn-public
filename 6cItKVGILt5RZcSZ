* :6cItKVGILt5RZcSZ: on 2008-12-27, Israel and the US very deliberately attacked Gaza in the middle of a Saturday when there were sure to be many people milling around in the streets.  They killed 200 and injured 700 more Palestinians, trapped in a cage with nowhere to flee.  On another Saturday two weeks later, Israel barred humanitarian shipments to Gaza on the grounds that it was a holy day.
