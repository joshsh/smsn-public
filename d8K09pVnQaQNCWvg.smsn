@title the voltage appears to approach 4.2 volts (not 3.7!) asymptotically. However, the battery started almost fully charged. It must hold its charge pretty well, as I don't think I had charged any of these batteries in some time. The 1000mAh battery in my collection is at 4.02V, while the 400mAh battery is at 3.86V, and the four 110mAh are completely discharged.
