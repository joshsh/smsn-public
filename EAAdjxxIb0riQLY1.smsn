@title on 2017-11-25, I experimented with the responsiveness of the S-pen, expecting to find that it enforced a certain speed limit on writing and drawing. Above a certain speed, things simply wouldn't be legible. I found instead that I was unable to move the pen back and forth across the screen fast enough that the accuracy of the path on screen started to break down; the sampling rate was more than high enough to keep up with ordinary drawing or writing. However, there is indeed a lag, which becomes more visible the faster you move the pen. The visual feedback of the device therefore leaves something to be desired, though the device is about as good as pencil and paper in terms of accuracy. I can sign my name as rapidly as I like without encountering any undersampling funkiness.
