@title I took the Pepsi Challenge with a blue Stabilo (which I picked up in the check-out line at Michael's yesterday for this purpose) vs. a blue Staedtler. I find that the Staedtler wins in three categories: its triangular grip is more ergonomic than the Stabilo's hexagonal grip, the cap snaps on and off more easily (while never having come off accidentally, that I recall), and it is a deeper shade of blue which I slightly prefer. There were no classic red Stabilo pens at the store yesterday; otherwise I would have compared both. Staedtler it is from here on out, unless I find another pen I like even more.
