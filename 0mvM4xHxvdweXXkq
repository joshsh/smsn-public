* :0mvM4xHxvdweXXkq: cellulite is thought to occur in 80â€“90% of post-adolescent females. There appears to be a hormonal component to its presentation. It is rarely seen in males, but is more common in males with androgen-deficient states, such as Klinefelter's syndrome, hypogonadism, postcastration states and in those patients receiving estrogen therapy for prostate cancer
