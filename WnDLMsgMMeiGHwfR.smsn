@title in virtually all cases the inside of the cell membrane is negative relative to the outside; typical membrane potentials are between −30 and −70 mV. The potential across the surface membrane of most animal cells generally does not vary with time. In contrast, neurons and muscle cells — the principal types of electrically active cells — undergo controlled changes in their membrane potential
