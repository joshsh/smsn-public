Thinking more about it, the extensional|intensional divide is not enough information. Consider the statement "logic helps kindness". Implicitly it creates a relationship between logic and kindness, but neither of those is clearly intensional or extensional to (i.e. neither should cover) the other. 

I believe such a statement would most naturally descend from the two members it relates, without making either of those members descend from the other.

Nodes of the form "see also" could be like this, to avoid cycles. If one for instance had made "optics" a child of "vision" and felt uncomfortable because neither should really descend from the other, one could instead make a node, "vision depends on optics" and made it a child of both.
