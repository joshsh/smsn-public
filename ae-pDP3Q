* :e-pDP3Q: as of a 2013 article, there are "1,000 active duty Hindu soldiers in the US Armed Forces, and a further 4,000 or so more working for various branches of the military as civilians". According to Wikipedia, citing DMDC, "as of 31 December 2013, 1,369,532 people were on active duty in the armed forces", so that's about 0.1% Hindu.
