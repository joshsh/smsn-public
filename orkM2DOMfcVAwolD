@title "One reason for considering audiovisual correspondences as representing one of the best potential candidates for being ‘automatic’ is that they have been suggested to operate as ‘coupling priors’ in Bayesian Decision Theory models of multisensory integration (see Ernst, 2007; Spence, 2011). Many coupling priors are considered to operate in an automatic manner: Helbig and Ernst (2008), for example, have demonstrated that the integration of visual and haptic shape information is unaffected by the focus of a participant’s attention to a specific sensory modality by means of an attentional load manipulation."
