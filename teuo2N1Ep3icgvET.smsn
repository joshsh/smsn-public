@title "[...] the question of whether spatial and temporal ventriloquism actually depends on the same a priori criteria for intersensory binding. Surprisingly, from the literature, it appears that this is most likely not the case. There is a well-established finding that a variety of multisensory illusions are preserved over a time window of several hundred milliseconds surrounding simultaneity, giving rise to the notion of a “temporal window of integration” (Colonius & Diederich, 2004; Dixon & Spitz, 1980; van Wassenhove, Grant & Poeppel, 2007)"
