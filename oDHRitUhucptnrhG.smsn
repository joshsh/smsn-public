@title flying over an unpopulated area on my way back to RHV. I wanted to fly my habitual route from Calaveras Reservoir to RHV, but this required overflying the reservoir first, where there are no lights. I inferred from the radio towers on top of what I assumed to be Mission Peak that I was high enough, but this was too casual an assumption. I also knew that my altitude of 5500' MSL was sufficient to overfly all of the East Bay Foothills, but again I think I should have just avoided the unlit area entirely, as it was not necessary to take the risk of being wrong. Had I misjudged my altitude or the height of the mountains, I could have impacted a mountainside with no warning.
