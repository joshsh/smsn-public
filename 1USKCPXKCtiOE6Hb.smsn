@title we consider the special case Σ=Σst ∪ Σt with Σst a set of source-to-target tgds and Σt a set of target tgds and egds. With these restrictions, (σ, τ, Σst, Σt) is known in the literature as a data exchange setting\u03A3=\u03A3st \u222A \u03A3t with \u03A3st a set of source-to-target tgds and \u03A3t a set of target tgds and egds. With these restrictions, (\u03C3, \u03C4, \u03A3st, \u03A3t) is known in the literature as a data exchange setting
