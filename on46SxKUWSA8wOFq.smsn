@title although the headphones are symmetrical with respect to the audio input (regardless of the mono/stereo setting) and can be worn with the microphone on either side, if you wear them with the microphone and cable on the left side, this will agree with the "L" and "R" volume knobs. It also seems more appropriate if you in the left seat and the audio inputs are on the left.
