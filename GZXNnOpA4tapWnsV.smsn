@title "Whereas a temporal interval of about 2 msec between two brief sounds appears to be sufficient to enable a listener to report that there are two sounds, and one, a considerably greater interval must elapse if the listener is to report correctly the order in which the sounds occurred. This greater temporal interval appears to be about ten times larger, or about 17 msec for the judgments to be 75% correct."
