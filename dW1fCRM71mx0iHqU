* :dW1fCRM71mx0iHqU: the data was annotated in real time by typing lines of text on the Twiddler chording keyboard (a commercially available one-handed key entry device). When a line of text was completed (when the “Enter” key was pressed) the text was time stamped with Unix time plus milliseconds and logged in a text file. This annotation scheme allows for precise matching of labels with data. Labels recorded in this way included single character abbreviation for common states, such as “w” for starting to walk and “s” for stopping, as well as longer free-form annotation
