* :XppabpCOGG4keU7R: a Letter from the Editor (of IEEE Intelligent Systems) which speculates on "software surrogates" (agents which perform our tasks for us within cyberspace), as well as David Gelernter's concept of "mirror worlds" (detailed digital representations of the real world, like Google Earth) and Hugh Everett's notion of "parallel universes".  Mirror worlds are likened to parallel universes in cyberspace.
