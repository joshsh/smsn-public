@title the placement depends of course very much on the activity. For ’leg-only’ activities, such as walking or stairs, sensors on the legs, e.g. hip and/or ankle, are sufficient. For those activities a single sensor mounted on the shoulder also obtained good recognition performance. For more complex activities such as writing on a whiteboard, sensors both on the upper and lower part of the body are required
