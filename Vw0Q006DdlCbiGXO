In traditional demonstration of the ventriloquism aftereffect, the acquisition takes minutes or even longer (Frissen et al., 2003; Recanzone, 1998). More recent evidence, though, has shown that the acquisition of a spatial ventriloquist aftereffect can be very fast, even after a single exposure to auditoryâ€“visual discrepancy, while the retention of the aftereffect is strong (Frissen et al., 2012; Wozny & Shams, 2011b)."
