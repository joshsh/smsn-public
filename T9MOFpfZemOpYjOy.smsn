@title "It is noteworthy that while AV speech recognition remains robust for âˆ¼300 ms, the detection of asynchrony between simpler auditory (tone) and visual (flash) stimuli is on the order of 25 ms to 50 ms (e.g. Hirsh & Sherrick, 1961; Zampini, Guest, Shore, & Spence, in press; Zampini, Shore, & Spence, 2003). Perception of AV simultaneity for complex spectro-temporal signals such as AV speech may involve auditory-visual correlation over a larger temporal window than would be expected on the basis of simpler AV stimuli, for which the comparison of onsets may suffice."
