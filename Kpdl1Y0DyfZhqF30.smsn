@title [markdown]The parental relationship naturally gives rise to "trees". If there are children, then there are grandchildren, and great-grandchildren, etc. For instance, one note might say `things to do`. One of its children might be `things to do on the computer`, another `things to do on Tuesday`. We say that both of those children are "under" the "parent" `things to do`. The children of `things to do on the computer` might include `email my state representative` and `look for musical instruments on Craigslist`. Those two children of `things to do on the computer` are "grandchildren" of `things to do`.
