* :mVSlta0g9UClxyvF: the variation in PSS values (and their small standard deviations) across observers suggests that each observer has a PSS that is statistically different from most other observers. Moreover, the distribution of PSS values across observers appears to be non-Gaussian (rather, it appears to be a uniform distribution)
