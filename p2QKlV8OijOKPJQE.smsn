@title I used a 12V, 1A adapter this time, and also measured the force of the jet at varying distance.  I taped a small tape measure to the blower and held it abote a gram scale as steadily as I could, always aiming the jet so as to exert the greatest force on the scale.  I found the force to be gusty like the jet, so I did my best to read out the highest sustained reading at each height rather than the absolute maximum.  My measurements, although frought with difficulties of precision, reveal a clear bell-shaped curve: from about 10 to 50 cm, the force varies more or less linearly with distance, declining asymptotically to zero with greater distance and tapering off before reaching a max value at zero distance.
