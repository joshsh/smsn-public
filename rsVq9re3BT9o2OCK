* :rsVq9re3BT9o2OCK: this is an issue with all of my old PG notes files.  Many of them are taken down in a particular context (e.g. "notes from LDOW 2010"), but after they are imported to EoB, the context-based collections gradually dissolve, with items being reorganized into topic-based hierarchies.
