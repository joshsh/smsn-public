@title "Subjects were unable to improve beyond a certain point on these visually complex (e.g. the scenes) and similar (e.g. the similar figures) images, suggesting that given the amount of training, the auditory system is probably not capable of keeping track of all the information in the sound patterns, or of resolving the fine differences in the  and/or pitch dimension, or perhaps a different type of training (e.g. involving sensorimotor feedback) would be required for further improvement."
