@title the next day (2020-06-09) I also re-glued the entire keytops for keys 6 and 15. I hadn't even realized they were loose before Leon started playing with one of them. It doesn't look like they were glued very well in the first place; this time, I was sure to cover the entire surface with glue, then to press the keytop firmly against the key until excess glue came out along all upper edges of the keytop. I was also careful not to get any glue on the face of the keytop, which led to yellowish discoloration on some of the other white keys.
