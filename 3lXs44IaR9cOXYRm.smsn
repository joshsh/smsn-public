@title "I would like to cut a clavichord keyboard, consisting of 49 keys in a lightweight wood such as pine. The keys would be cut out of a single block about 28" wide, 14" tall, and 1/2" thick. This can be accomplished with around 320 straight cuts. I created a previous version of this keyboard manually using a jigsaw, but am exploring laser cutting for better precision/aesthetics. If your equipment also supports drilling holes before cutting, each of the 49 keys needs three vertical holes (for metal pins and tangents), one 1/16" wide and two slightly narrower. Thanks."
