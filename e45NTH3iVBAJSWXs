* :e45NTH3iVBAJSWXs: "there is evidence that shy people believe that the nonverbal signals they produce are often ignored in favour of the talkativeness, and the self expression of others [35]. This position is supported by research [7] which indicates that social judgements are often made based on more extroverted behaviours such as smiling, and talkativeness. As such, shy people may be  contributing to a social interaction in a nonverbal manner, but these contributions may be overlooked in favour of more explicit social signals. It also suggests that shy people may feel happy contributing to an interaction nonverbal channels, where they may feel uncomfortable maintaining an interaction by verbal means. Future work within this area could seek to develop ambient displays, and pervasive technologies that can amplify, or draw attention to, a shy participantâ€™s contributions to a social interaction, and as a result make this nonverbal contribution to a social interaction more available to the non-shy."
