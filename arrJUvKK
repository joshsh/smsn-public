* :rrJUvKK: I've been meaning to get back to you, I just never want to do it, because you bum me out. Each time we talk you're like nothing matters and everything's horrible, and I don't believe you and neither of us is starting to believe like the other, so we feel like a waste of time to me. I don't want to hurt your feelings, I only hope the truth is more helpful than no explanation.
