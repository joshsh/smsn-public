@title "According to Spence (2011; see also Deroy et al., in press; Sadaghiani et al., 2009), many crossmodal correspondences likely result from an organism picking up on the statistical regularities that are present in the environment, and occur for pairs of stimulus dimensions that happen to be correlated in nature (Spence & Deroy, 2012). Others, though, are likely to involve further structural or internal determinants that fall naturally out of the organisation of the organismâ€™s mind/perceptual system."
