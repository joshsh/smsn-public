@title that is, all of the sensors I have purchased for the Monitron, apart from the gas sensors I have decided to save for later, have been connected to the microcontroller with hoookup wire cut to length (rather than jumper wires) and have been tested for normal operation.  The "head" Arduino sketch runs normally with my remaining Arduino Nano and connected to the Media Room laptop rather than Marvin V (which has two bad USB ports which has killed Colin V's original battery and might be responsible for the death of the second Nano).  My original layout of sensors had been getting messy, and I thought I could make things more efficient by putting the right-angle headers (for attaching peripheral sensors and the RGB LED) in the middle of the breadboard, leaving some space on either side for breakout boards and other stuff.  So I took everything out and started afresh.  I'm glad I did: not only is the device more organized, but this gave me a chance to put all of my notes on the components of the Head to the test, and improve them where they were lacking.
