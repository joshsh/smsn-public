# The tuning
Low E, wound, 32 lbs => 0.05858" a.k.a. 58.6
A, wound, 28 lbs => 41
D, wound, 26 pounds => 29.6
G, wound, 24 pounds => 21.3
B, plain, 22 pounds => 15.6
high E, plain, 20 pounds => 11.1

## Other values for the low E I considered:
Low E, wound, 31 lbs => 0.0576" a.k.a. 57.6
  Problem: Tune this down to D and the result is a tension of 24 lbs

# calculations
The site I used for calculations:
  https://wahiduddin.net/calc/calc_guitar_string.htm

# goals
The site below says a good(easy + good tone) string tension range is between 20 and 30 lbs.
I'll try tensions from 20 on the high strings to 30 on the low ones.
I'll make the low E even a little more tense, because sometimes I tune it down to D.

# evidence those goals are based on
These strings:

have tensions all over the place, from 17 to 40.

D'Addario's 10s range in tension from about 16 lbs to 20 lbs:

They have the low E a little floppier than the low A, which always feels dumb to me, so I won't do that.
I hope that doesn't mean my low E will overpower the others.
