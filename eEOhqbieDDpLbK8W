* :eEOhqbieDDpLbK8W: the outcome of a deep, painful feeling of personal inadequacy for being unable to reach one's goal.  The very act of setting a utopian goal creates a situation in which the unattainability of the goal is not blamed on its utopian nature but rather on one's ineptitude: my life should be rich and rewarding, but I am living in banality and boredom; I should have intense feelings but cannot awaken them in myself
