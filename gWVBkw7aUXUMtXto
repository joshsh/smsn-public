@title [markdown]To edit a note's `title` (its text), just change the text where you see it. Just be sure not to edit the note's leading bullet, or the space immediately after that bullet, because some hidden characters in that space encode the note's ID. The ID is a random-looking string like ":Y2rcZ4zKAoCBRfBw:".
