* :MgIJiXsGDRnOUl7l: subjects were given a short amount of time to memorize twenty random women's names and faces.  They were then asked to identify each woman's face while wearing the HMD.  Some of the subjects received a correct subliminal cue (the right name) for each face, while others received an incorrect subliminal cue (a wrong name), and yet others received no cue at all
