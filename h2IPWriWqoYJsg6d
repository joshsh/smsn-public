* :h2IPWriWqoYJsg6d: as a virtue, accountability is "the willingness to stand in responsibility for every choice. It is acting with integrity, doing what we say we will do. When we make a mistake we do not seek to hide it or avoid it. We have the courage to face it willingly. We are open to the lessons it can bring, and ready to make amends" [from http://www.utsalumni.org/news/virtue-for-the-week-accountability-4805/]
