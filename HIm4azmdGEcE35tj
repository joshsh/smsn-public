* :HIm4azmdGEcE35tj: [markdown] The explicit sequencing relationship in linear text is used to represent many implicit relationships. Sometimes, passage X follows passage Y because Y causes X, or Y depends on X, or the reverse. Sometimes X is what happened next. Sometimes X is a definition that explains the meaning of Y. Sometimes X is a radical change of subject. Until a reader has read both passages, they can only be certain that the author considered it a good idea to read them in that order.
