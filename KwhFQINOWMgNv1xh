* :KwhFQINOWMgNv1xh: experimental subjects were presented with audio and visual stimuli which were separated by a small but consistent lag.  The point of subjective simultaneity of these subjects was found to vary consistently and adaptively by as much as 59ms depending on the lag, suggesting that the human brain is capable of recalibrating itself in response to the constant audiovisual lag accompanying correlated signals
