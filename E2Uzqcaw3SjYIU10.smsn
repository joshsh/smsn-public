@title ``What distinguishes ACLs from past such efforts are the objects of discourse and their semantic complexity. ACLs like KQML or FIPA ACL, stand a level above CORBA, because: (1) they handle propositions, rules and actions instead of simple objects (with no semantics associated with them), and (2) the ACL message describe a desired state in a declarative language, rather than a procedure or method.''
