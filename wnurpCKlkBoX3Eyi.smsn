@title as with the approach to KPAO, I was underprepared for the approach to KSQL. I knew the expected heading to the airport, and I knew the runway heading (30), but I did not have a plan for intercepting the straight-in approach other than to spot the field first, which I was unable to do. Since the tower was not in operation, there was no beacon, and I orbited once before entering what would have been the class D airspace, so as to give myself more time to get the field in sight. Instead, a Skyhawk came along and did an instrument approach, so I simply followed it. As the Skyhawk then chose to do a simulated missed approach, and I still did not have the field in sight, I entered a right pattern following the Skyhawk, whereas I could have just landed straight-in. This took some extra time, but I landed without difficulty; I found that the VASI wasn't really essential in such good visibility. The sky was moonless, as I had anticipated, but the city lights provided a good ground reference. I landed, taxied to the transient parking, and again got out to eat a snack and plan my next leg. I had to activate the pilot-controlled lighting just before takeoff.
