@title "There were three presentation conditions: haptic alone, vision alone, and visual–haptic. To measure discrimination performance in all three presentation conditions, we used a three-interval forced-choice (3-IFC) oddity task. We chose an oddity task because it allows to quantitatively model the discrimination results and because it is not susceptible to criterion biases such as, for example, a 2-IFC same/different task would be. Subjects sequentially saw and/or felt three objects (little squares) from the two-dimensional visual–haptic stimulus space. Each square was presented for 500 ms. Two of the stimuli were identical and one was different in some aspect (luminance, stiffness, or both). Their task was to identify the interval containing the odd stimulus ( Figure 4)."
