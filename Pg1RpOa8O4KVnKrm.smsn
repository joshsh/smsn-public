@title for flight tracking, use setting "0" (fast as possible) sampling. I chose this option for the first time on 2018-03-25, and the resulting track is much clearer than the previous two were. It is clear enough that the rectangles and circles I flew during the lesson ( on ground reference maneuvers) can be easily inspected for precision.
