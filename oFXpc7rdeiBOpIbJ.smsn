@title "Albeit not undisputed (e.g., Itier & Taylor, 2004; Liu et al., 2002; Pegna, Khateb, Michel, & Landis, 2004), it is usually assumed that specialized neural systems in human inferotemporal cortex are activated by faces around 150â€“200 ms poststimulus onset, as indexed by the face-selective N170 component in EEG (or M170 in MEG), measured over the scalp at occipitotemporal electrodes (Bentin et al., 1996; George et al., 1996), or by the corresponding N200 measured intracranially in the inferior lateral temporal cortex (Allison, McCarthy, Nobre, Puce, & Belger, 1994; McCarthy et al., 1999)"
