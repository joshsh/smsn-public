@title according to James, "It would be rash to say definitely just how many seconds long this specious present must needs be, for processes fade 'asymptotically,' and the distinctly intuited present merges into a penumbra of mere dim recency before it turns into the past which is simply reproduced and conceived."  However, he later states that it varies in length "from a few seconds to probably not more than a minute".  The sense of recency, he says, may last for hours.
