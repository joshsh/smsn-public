@title "In the first experiment, subjects were asked to make a three-alternative forced-choice judgment whether the audio stimulus and the tactile stimulus were synchronous, the audio stimulus preceded the tactile stimulus, or the tactile stimulus preceded the audio stimulus. Stimuli with audio delays in the range of â€“26 to 51 ms were judged synchronous."
