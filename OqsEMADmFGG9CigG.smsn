@title Steve Mann notes that DEC named their computers "PDP" (Programmable Data Processor) because the term "computer" had been over-sold.  The term had been all the rage, and the resulting hype had created inflated expecations.  The field of AI suffered a similar fate.  For this reason, Steve warns against too much press for wearable computing.
