* :4kSvKo1J1fee413r: I anonymize (at least so far, mostly, when intentional) only bad reports, ones that could make someone look bad. Theoretically, that avoids rewarding bad behavior with fame. More practically, those stories are dangerous to tell -- word might get back to them -- and it's hard to anonymize on the fly at the speed of conversation, so the tendency is to not talk about those things otherwise.
