* :MM-L7EB: Rand Fishkin, the "wizard" and former CEO of Moz, admits a early fear of ignorance, but says he has learned to quickly raise questions when he gets lost. "The key, at least for me, is to admit I’m an idiot and free myself of the stigma and fear". Not just to those around me, and not as a form of self-deprecating theatre, either. But because in order to make good decisions I have to understand the issues, the problems and the potential solutions. That doesn’t always require deep technical chops, but it does mean asking a lot questions, some of them potentially dumb, embarassing ones."
