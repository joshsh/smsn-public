@title It often feels like progress to clean up my own curse-laden writing -- whether for publication (e.g. bug reports) or not. Maybe that's because I curse when I haven't precisely put into words my complaint, and once I do, any reason for being upset is conveyed intrinsically, without need to declare it explicitly.
