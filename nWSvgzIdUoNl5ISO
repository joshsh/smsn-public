@title [markdown]smsn-mode has two submodes: edit-mode (the default) and move-submode. Every shortcut available in edit-submode is available in move-submode. Move-submode provides a few additional ones, for speed. You will know which submode you are in by the color of the cursor: It is black in edit-submode, and green in move-submode. Toggle between them with `C-c m`.
