@title [markdown]Our knowledge graph is an inclusive community. If you think an expression deserves to exist, there is surely a good place for it -- often more than one. (You might have to create the place, but once you do it can exist forever.) Whatever it is -- fact or fiction, logic or emotion, art or science, analysis, criticism, questions, answers, dreams -- we can process them together.
