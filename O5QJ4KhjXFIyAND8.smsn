@title "Now whole objects or whole word recognition is also strongly linked to pre-existing semantic representations of objects: for instance, the knowledge of what plants and keys are, is used when learning to recognize them with the vOICe. [...] A prediction of the present model is that such restoration effects might be found in sensory substitution as well, with users missing or distorting the identification of low-level features due to the recognition of global templates, and relatedly, of the attribution or expectation of a certain meaning. Given this prediction, a minor feature-inversion in the auditory conversion of an object with the vOICe should remain undetected if the global object template is familiar."
