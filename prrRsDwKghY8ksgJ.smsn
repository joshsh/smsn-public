@title a basic kind of language consists of linking basic symbols to sense impressions. A further stage deals with associations between those symbols.  If language is to lead to understanding, there must be rules concerning the relations between the signs on the one hand, and on the other hand, there must be a stable correspondence between signs and impressions.  As children, we learn these rules by intuition, but when we become aware of them, grammar is established.  When language becomes relatively independent of the background of impressions, a greater inner coherence is attained.  Only at this further stage of development, where frequent use is made of abstract concepts, language becomes an instrument of reasoning in the true sense of the word.  At the same time, however, language becomes misleading if the connection with sense impressions is lost.
