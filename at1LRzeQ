* :t1LRzeQ: "We find evidence of fast learning in both the multisensory and unisensory groups (see Figure 2). More importantly, we find that learning occurred significantly more quickly for the multisensory group (Figure 2, black line) than for unisensory group (Figure 2, gray line). [...] These results demonstrate that within a single session, multisensory training offers benefits over unisensory training."
