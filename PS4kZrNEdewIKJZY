* :PS4kZrNEdewIKJZY: in the past, I have been concerned about creating too many links to any given note, as this will overwhelm the "backward" view from that note.  In the days when I thought EoB was evolving toward an undirected data model, any imbalance between inbound and outbound links was undesirable.  Now that I have given up that idea, though, it seems to me that allowing the knowledge base to adopt a natural, scale-free structure, in which a minority of notes have very many in-links, is perfectly OK.  Perhaps even ideal.
