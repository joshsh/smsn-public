* :ULstlpUX5MP3tCHQ: lately (as of 2012-10-27), ellipses have started to take on a more specific function, which I hope will morph into core Extend-o-Brain functionality: I use them to flag items at the top of my mental stack... things I would like to get back to and execute some action upon.  E.g. if I flag the item for cybernetics, it's because I have yet to read the Wikipedia article on Cybernetics.  If I flag my notes on "feedback loops I have known and loved", it's because I was in the process of adding new notes there, and I'm not finished.  This might provide the most basic way in which MOB knows to "pull" information from me... just push the items I meant to get back to, and let me fill in the blanks and remove the ellipses.
