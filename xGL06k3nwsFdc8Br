* :xGL06k3nwsFdc8Br: human beings usually tolerate some amount of temporal discrepancy between two signals while still perceiving them as being synchronous. It is unknown how large the discrepancy between visual and haptic signals may be before users start noticing that the signals are asynchronous. Quantification of the noticeable delay is of considerable interest for designers of visualhaptic displays because it defines the minimum temporal resolution that is required to optimize the overall realism that users experience.
