@title "In some sense, qualia have been evident in the tactile sensory substitution experience, but in a limited fashion. For example, school-age children perceiving the flame of a candle for the first time, are always pleased by the experience, especially when their actions influence the sensory message, such as when they blow gently on the candle and perceive the flickering flame. A university student who had just married showed great interest and pleasure in the exploration of typical kitchen instruments and activities, such as in the process of baking a cake. Another was delighted that the three-dimensional images helped her to understand the structure of a traffic intersection. A leprosy patient who had lost all sensation in his hands expressed great pleasure when he perceived the sensation of his active touch of his wife, using a glove with artificial tactile receptors that transmitted the information from active touch to the skin of the forehead where his sensation was intact."
