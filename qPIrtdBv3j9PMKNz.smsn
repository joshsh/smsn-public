@title the motor is not *felt* to move at timesteps below 60ms or so (when held lightly between the thumb and index finger, or between the lips), but it is *seen* to move at as little as 10ms (when dangling by its wires).  There is a vibration of the chosen duration, then a 1000ms rest before the cycle repeats.
