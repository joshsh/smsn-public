exchange argument: take OPT (MST) T*. Suppose to the contrary, that e not in T*.
       Will show how to change T* so it does contain e, and becomes cheaper.
       For any u in S and v in (V-S), there is a path in T* from u to v.  Let f be the edge in this path in (S, V-S).  T*-f+e is a spanning tree.
       Must show all pairs {v, W} are connected by T*-f+e.
       If path in T* from u to v did not use f, good.
       If path P_w1_w2 uses edge f_y know there is a path in T*-f+e from x_1 to u
