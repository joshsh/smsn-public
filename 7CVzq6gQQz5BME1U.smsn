@title [markdown]Edit-submode shortcuts begin with `C-c`, and are always available. If a command involves a modifier key (`C` or `M`) and does not start with `C-c`, then it is built into Emacs, and works both in smsn-mode and in other modes. If a shortcut does not involve a modifier key, it is only available while in move-submode.
