* :bpPG5RO: the three-key chords chosen deliberately avoid the 1 key, as the "modifier" key is the last key to be released and 1 is especially awkward in that role.  We avoid releasing the modifier key within the chord, as the resulting chords would collide with future regular series of characters or symbols attached to the 26 letters
