* :f2Xbi-p: "Particular values for the temporal acuity of different sense modalities based upon the distinction between successiveness and simultaneity have been given by many authors. Exner's (1875) values for vision and for agree reasonably well with more recent data on visual flicker (Hartley, 1958, pp. 120-121), and on auditory successiveness (Miller & Taylor, 1948; Wallach, Newman, & Rosenzweig, 1949). Values of temporal acuity for the skin are less well established (Geldard, 1940). There is some evidence that different fis, have used quite dissimilar criteria for tactual fusion. It is clear that this simple temporal acuity varies with the sense modality used and may indeed be ascribed to the resolving power of peripheral mechanisms."
