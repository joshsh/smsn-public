@title [markdown]If you have been part of a (good) study group, you know the power of sharing written knowledge with others. Studying the same body of knowledge makes it easier to communicate with your partners. Easier communication leads to faster processing of ideas, and with that speed, you can afford to consider more kinds of ideas. With each member contributing knowledge (notes), and each cooperatively helping to organize that knowledge, we can understand more material, more quickly. (And that is only the power of sharing in *small* groups about *one* subject. A knowledge graph greatly relieves those scale restrictions.)
