* :u3r541Vtn6KsM8yH: "Olfactory stimuli consisted of four pleasant and four unpleasant odors, comprising a total of eight distinct semantic categories. Two food and two nonfood odors were included within each hedonic class. [...] Visual stimuli consisted of 32 high-resolution color images of everyday objects. For each of the eight odors, four different pictures were selected on the basis of shared semantic attributes. For example, pictures of ice cream, cookies, cake, and chocolate were chosen because of their semantic similarity to vanillin odor.
