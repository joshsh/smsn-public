@title the EEG reflects thousands of simultaneously ongoing brain processes. This means that the brain response to a single stimulus or event of interest is not usually visible in the EEG recording of a single trial. To see the brain's response to a stimulus, the experimenter must conduct many trials (100 or more[citation needed]) and average the results together, causing random brain activity to be averaged out and the relevant waveform to remain, called the ERP
