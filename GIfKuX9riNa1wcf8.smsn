@title Social media platforms (usually?) reduce a person's ability to target separate social spheres.

In Twitter or Facebook, for instance, you generally shout into a single void. If you'd like to send a message at, say, all your programmer friends, you can't. (Actually on Facebook you can but it's a pain.)

For this reason, popularity on a social media platform is correlated with "character specialization". If you write about a single niche, it's feasible for everything you publish to be excellent, so much so that it draws a large audience. If you want to write about lots of different stuff, the stuff you're not an expert at will tend to push away the audience that might otherwise follow you for what you're good at.
