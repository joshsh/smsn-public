* :itx46fNA1RVnFKGj: Writing’s value is arguably not intuitive: If writing merely expresses a thought one has already had in one’s head, why should it help? And yet the ancients recognized that recording one’s favorite thoughts (on a specific subject or generally) over a long period of time, and then reading them in a much shorter time, allowed one to come to insights not possible at the slower time scale – to say nothing of the possibilities for exchanging ideas in greater density with others.
