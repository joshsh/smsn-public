* :5bBAecLiSy28jCuR: "Our most important finding in the examination of learning processes involving extensive training was generalized of the visual-to-auditory substitution system. As the improved ability to discriminate the sounds of novel stimuli suggests, the performance was not simply based on a mere association between the visual images and their corresponding sounds, but on the application of the image-to-sound conversion rules to novel stimuli. The improved performance on novel items indicates that the mechanism behind the improvement is learning of the fundamental relationship between the visual and auditory patterns and the ability to apply the visualâ€“auditory relationship in order to decode the novel visual information via the auditory input."
