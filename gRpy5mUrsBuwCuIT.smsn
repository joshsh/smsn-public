@title "Several recent scalp-ERP studies have reported emotion effects occurring during a much earlier time-window, affecting the amplitude of the exogenous visual P1 component over posterior cortex (Batty & Taylor, 2003; Eger et al., 2003; Pizzagalli, Regard, & Lehmann, 1999; Pourtois, Dan, Grandjean, Sander, & Vuilleumier, 2005; Streit et al., 2003), as well as some fronto-central components arising at the same latency around 120 ms post-face onset (Eimer & Holmes, 2002 and 2007)."
