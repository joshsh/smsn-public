Imagination, responsibly used, can be a powerful force for good. I believe we should be wildly optimistic, sometimes, and we should consider all possibilities, spending time on each possibility proportionally to their likelihood.

Imagining terrible actions by others, in particular, is harmful if done out of proportion to its likelihood.

Religion does not, but Science offers repeatable experiments you can use to trust someone's claims. Pi is a little more than three, things accelerate as they fall, perceptual errors a blind spot are discoverable, cooperation is helpful, diversity (of species, of individual and cultural wisdom) is surprising and beautiful, social science is predictive, the earth is curved, the nearest next planet is damn far away. At no point does Science demand I believe something without offering evidence I could verify for myself.

Powerful religions, by definition, use belief to control people. Before I will let someone influence how I vote, I should demand a higher evidentiary standard than "because they say so" (as certain christian americans allow the belief about when which an organism has a soul deserving protection determine how they vote on questions of economics).

And there's good news: On all but the distant edges, The students of science agree! That's why graduate research is boring! We only need to come home, to believe ourselves.
