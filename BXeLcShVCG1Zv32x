@title In linear text -- such as a newspaper article -- there is only one kind of relationship between statements: "Read this after that." The writer decides the sequence. In a knowledge graph, "so-and-so suggests read this after that" is one kind of relationship, but many others are possible: "This is an example of that", "This explains that", "This is a funny story about that, " ... In a knowledge graph, the writer does not tell the reader what to do. The writer records what is, and the reader chooses how to travel the knowledge.
