@title "After sufficient training (always a concern with animal studies), the chimps were able to respond as rapidly as their human counterparts. However, on every trial, when the two squares were presented on the screen, a high or low tone was presented in the background [...]. Both groups of participants responded significantly more rapidly to the white (black) square when the high (low) tone was presented than when the mapping was reversed."
