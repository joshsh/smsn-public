@title "Rather than attempting to emulate human intelligence in the computer, as is a common goal of research in AI, the goal of WearComp is to produce a synergistic combination of human and machine in which the human performs tasks that it is better at while the computer performs tasks that it is better at. Over an extended period of time, WearComp begins to function as a true extension of the mind and body and no longer feels as if it is a separate entity"
