* :p8OBJNtTf8qFvzbr: Somewhat opposite to that, expression also makes it easier to let go of something. The unresolved feeling after an awkward encounter, for instance, can be a subconscious call to action: "Something went wrong, behavioral change needed, there is something to figure out." Identify the problem, put it into words, and you will find greater peace.
