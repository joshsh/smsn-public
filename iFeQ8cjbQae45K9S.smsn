@title the game consists of a man (A), a woman (B), and an interrogator (C).  C's job is to determine which of A and B is the man and which is the woman.  A's job is to answer C's questions in such a way as to make C believe that he is actually B, a woman.  B's job is to help C, most likely by giving truthful answers to C's questions.  Now let A be a machine (a digital computer) instead of a man.
