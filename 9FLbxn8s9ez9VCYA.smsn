@title It regularly leads me to consider privacy's effects. What sorts of ideas will someone only record in private? Which get lost because they are not shared? What potential lies in the shades of intimacy between total privacy and total openness? I aim in Semantic Synchrony for a generalization of privacy, simultaneously more granular and less demanding of user oversight, that allows someone to choose to share which kind of idea with which kind of audience.
