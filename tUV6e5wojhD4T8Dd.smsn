@title [markdown]The text of a note can have any length. Each note has a unique `ID`, which is a set of 16 alphanumeric characters. The ID can be thought of as the note's address in the graph. Note IDs are usually provided between ":" marks, so they look something like this: `:axMIDS0EmKQXqMnm:`. In addition to text content and ID, notes have other properties, described later.
