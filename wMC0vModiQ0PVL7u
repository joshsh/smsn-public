* :wMC0vModiQ0PVL7u: I never followed up on it, but it was good advice.  It must have been around the time I was involved in the Young Writer's Conference, or perhaps a while after (I seem to remember being a bit older).  He suggested that, whenever I encounter an interesting person / notice an interesting detail of a person in my everyday life, I write it down.  I can then draw from this collection of notes in my fiction writing.
