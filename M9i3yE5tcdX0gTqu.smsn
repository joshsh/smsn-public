@title e.g. if you have had an argument with your boss, you can either feel sorry for yourself and worry about the consequences, or focus details of the incident: rehearse what went on at different moments during the argument, what may have precipitated the event.  In this way, you are processing information which is relevant to the event.  This will help to avoid having the same thing happen again.
