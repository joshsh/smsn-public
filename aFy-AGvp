* :Fy-AGvp: Part of my enthusiasm for the Semantic Web comes from the economic research experience. Every economic data set, though "just" a grid of numbers, is a uniquely labor intensive object, for both its authors and its users. The codebook is separate from the data, and they easily fall out of sync. The amount of effort we duplicated -- learning how to read each new data set, devising integrity tests to accommodate its idiosyncracies, re-creating the kinds of tables we preferred from the tables we had -- was staggering. Researchers I know in other fields face similar problems.
