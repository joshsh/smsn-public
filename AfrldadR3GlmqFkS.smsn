@title near the end of the book, we discover that the nightmarish ecology that has evolved around the human colony has been a reaction to the humans' own mistreatment of the wildlife.  We learn that the "grubbers", a group of peaceful outcasts who are despised by the colonists, have been living in harmony with nature, unprotected by weapons or other technology
