@title "According to a theoretical perspective dubbed ``the unity of the senses'' (Marks 1978), cross-modal interactions arise in part from intrinsic similarities in dimensions of experience among perceptual modalities and may reflect cross-talk within perceptual systems themselves. There are some instances, however, in which cross-modal interactions may arise only after information in different modalities is recoded into a more abstract format common to perceptual and linguistic systems (eg a semantic format). This idea we term the semantic coding hypothesis."
