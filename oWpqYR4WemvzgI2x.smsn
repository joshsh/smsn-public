@title "Not only is this vocabulary incredibly small, but the behaviors are not particularly iconic (e.g., what does a blinking light on a toaster mean? Is the toast done? Is it cooking? Is it jammed?). This often means people have to learn by rote what each light  behavior means on each device. This is unwieldy given the multitude of devices we use today."
