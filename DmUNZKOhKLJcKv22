* :DmUNZKOhKLJcKv22: "Visual preferences in infants not previously exposed to sound described an inverted U, indicating a preference for the light of intermediate intensity. In contrast, infants who were first exposed to sound preferred the light of lowest intensity. The results indicate that newborns attend to quantitative variations in stimulation and that these variations reflect both the objective stimulus intensity and organismic factor."
