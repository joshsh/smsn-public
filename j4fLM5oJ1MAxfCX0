* :j4fLM5oJ1MAxfCX0: in the 1900 US Federal Census, Albert is listed as "Burt Shenavare", and Leo is "Leo Shenavare".  What is very strange is that in 1900, Albert is married to "Allice Shenavare", whom he married in 1896, whereas in 1910 he is married to "Mable Chinavare", whom he also married in 1896, but the women have different birthdates.
