Deleted items are kept in an entry so that out-of-order arrival of change messages involving addition followed by deletion of the same string will not cause the wrong final state. Deleted items also provide a record of recent events for use by human administrators. We declare an upper bound of 14 days upon the clock asynchrony among the registration servers, on message delivery delay, and on administrative hindsight. The Grapevine servers each scan their local data base once a day during inactive periods and purge all deleted items older than the bound."
