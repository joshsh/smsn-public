* :Hf9ewHoXdvliDP8J: for lack of time (I have to present this application to Prof. Hendler in less than two weeks) I'm giving up on the gas sensors for now.  I bought five of these things, and I think that eventually I'll be able to make use of them.  However, a little experimentation with the CO sensor confirmed that these sensors are tricky to read, tricky to program (i.e. power-cycle appropriately), and tricky to calibrate.  Until I can calibrate them properly, they're useless for Monitron #1.  For now, they're going the way of the Hall sensor... removed because they don't add any value to the device.  At least I did arrive at a handy way to wire them (attaching F/F jumpers to four of the pins after connecting the three 5V pins with unheated solder wire, then braiding the four strands... no soldering required.
