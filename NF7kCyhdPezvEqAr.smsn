@text I feel bad asking Josh for features, and don't want to spam the issue tracker because I've got a lot of feature wants, so I'll just collect them under [one of the nodes that shows up from searching *smsn* and *want*] and if they seem easy, also under [something that shows up from searching *smsn* and *easy*].
