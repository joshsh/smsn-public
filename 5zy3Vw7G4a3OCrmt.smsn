@title "we can tell the compiler that we promise to assign a MountainBike to obj by explicit casting: `MountainBike myBike = (MountainBike)obj;`. This cast inserts a runtime check that obj is assigned a MountainBike so that the compiler can safely assume that obj is a MountainBike. If obj is not a MountainBike at runtime, an exception will be thrown."
