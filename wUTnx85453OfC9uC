@title [not-markdown]##### There are two ways sharability can control who sees what. (1) The view can be assigned a minimum sharability -- useful when viewing notes that have private contents in a public place. New views inherit the minimum from the relative they were opened from. (2) When two knowledge graphs are merged, it is possible to merge selectively, sharing only those nodes with a sharability higher than some threshold.
