# the vertical lines are made like this

plt.plot([t,t],[0,np.cos(t)],
         color ='blue',  linewidth=1.5, linestyle="--")

# the called-out points, and their labels, and the arrow from the label to the point,
# are made with the "annotate" command

# the points themselves are re-drawn with the "scatter" command
```
