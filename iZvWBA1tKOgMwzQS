* :iZvWBA1tKOgMwzQS: "A summary of brain theory is given so far as it is contained within the framework of Localization Theory. Diffculties of this conventional theory are traced back to a specific deficiency: there is no way to express relations between active cells (as for instance their representing parts of the same ob ject). A new theory is proposed to cure this deficiency. It introduces a new kind of dynamical control, termed synaptic modulation, according to which synapses switch between a conducting and a non-conducting state. The dynamics of this variable is controlled on a fast time scale by correlations in the temporal fine structure of cellular signals."
