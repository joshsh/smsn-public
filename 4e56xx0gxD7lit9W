* :4e56xx0gxD7lit9W: as .txt can share linearizations of a graph. life, in fact, is a linearization of a graph. the universe [of possible experiences] is the graph that time linearizes. to give someone a graph is to give them their own manifold to linearize. so it is to give someone a linearization of text, but the graph can make it much more evident which travels are interesting.
