* :-63SoSQ: I often wonder about privacy's effects.What sorts of ideas will someone only record in private? What sorts of ideas get lost because they are not shared? I aim in Semantic Synchrony for a generalization of privacy, simultaneously more granular and less demanding of user oversight, that allows someone to choose to share which kind of idea with which kind of audience.
