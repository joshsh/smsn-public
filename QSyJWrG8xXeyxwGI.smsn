@title I think it is becoming increasingly clear that "freeloading" is not appropriate for the EoB data model and for my PKB.  Some reasons why not: it is too easy to break the associations (because the root atom will often be seen outside of that one context), it forces the types of the associated atoms to accommodate an unlimited number of vocabulary elements (whereas the trend is to converge on a bounded schema for each type), an atom's child list may become arbitrarily large depending on how many mutually incompatible freeloading tuples it is contained in, the second item of the association is too time-consuming to spot among the children of any root atom with more than two or three (in part because it cannot appear in a predictable position in the child list, unless the type of the root node is constrained, which it need not be).  In short, eschew freeloading and create type-friendly tuples instead
