@title placing the vibration motor in contact with a microphone, we can see a signal picked up by the microphone in anywhere from two to three wavelengths of the motor's apparent frequency (very roughly 60 Hz), or around 15-30 ms. This is the time it takes for the motor to start tapping against the microphone; this doesn't contradict my earlier finding that 10 ms of power is enough to induce motion which can then be seen.
