* :y3jHW027kr40T1KF: "While considering this semantic issue regarding the development of multisensory integration, it may also be appropriate to consider abandoning the multiplicity of terms that are often invoked as synonyms in describing multisensory processes or multisensory brain regions. These include such terms such as ‘multimodal’, ‘intersensory’, ‘heteromodal’, ‘polymodal’ and ‘polysensory.’ Often, these terms are combined with the word ‘integration’, and often the same term is used to refer to physical stimuli and neural processes, as in the case of ‘cross-modal stimuli’ and ‘cross-modal integration.’"
