@title we primarily trained spins, after a long ground session. Scott demonstrated one spin, and IIRC I did two on my own. We lost about 1000 feet of altitude on each maneuver. Scott deliberately kept the air portion of the lesson short, and I saw the sense of it once we were on the ground, when I noticed that I was in fact a little nauseous. Prior to spins, Scott had me attempt to turn using the ailerons only, the rudder only, with and without corresponding changes to the elevator. The point of this was to illustrate how essential the elevator is in any turn; Scott even called it the primary flight control for turns.
