@title "Major, rapid performance improvements in perceptual training are often dismissed as 'task' or 'procedural' learning because they are fast and generalize within a task. We assessed the contributions of perceptual and procedural learning to improvement in an auditory tone frequency learning task in humans and found that perceptual learning accounted for between 76% and 98% of the rapid early performance improvement."
