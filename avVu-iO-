* :vVu-iO-: "This paper describes a psychophysical study of detectable time delay between a voluntary hammer tap and its auditory consequence (a percussive sound of either 1, 50, or 200 ms duration). The results show Just Noticeable Differences (JNDs) for temporal asynchrony of 24 ms with insignificant response bias. The invariance of JND and response bias as a function of sound duration in this experiment indicates that observers cued on the initial attack of the auditory stimuli."
