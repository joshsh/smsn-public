@title after overshooting PAO, flying over the water at only 1500'. Although this was the right thing to do from a traffic avoidance point of view, it seems very dangerous. No one would have known if I had gone down over the Bay. I was not using flight following because I had requested tower-to-tower, thinking PAO tower was in operation. I had given Xixi my flight plan, but in a worst case scenario, the plane and I probably wouldn't have been discovered until morning.
