@title a girlfriend and I find ourselves free-falling in an endless sky.  We have evidently been placed there by a higher intelligence, which ensures that we survive by sending us food and water in packages which fall just slightly faster than we do, arriving from above.  Initially, these are very simple objects, but as we learn to slow our descent, streamers and parachutes become necessary.  We intercept the deliveries and keep the cloth as well as the food, using it to build parachute structures of our own, which become increasingly large and elaborate, and bring us ever closer to a 1-G living environment, a sort of floating house.  Occasionally, our structure would collapse or one of us would fall off, forcing us to start afresh with a new design.
