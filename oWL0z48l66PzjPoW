* :oWL0z48l66PzjPoW: "The results from neurophysiological studies in animals have been used in support of the idea that the development of an ability to engage in multisensory integration requires a prolonged postnatal period because its emergence is dependent, in large part, on sensory experience (Wallace & Stein, 1997, 2001, 2007; Stein, 2005; Yu et al. 2010). During early life the brain is exposed to multiple iterations of events that provide cross-modal cues with similar statistics (they generally occur in spatiotemporal concordance). The effects of these sensory experiences appear to be cumulative and to be incorporated gradually into the nervous system. They are then reflected as a capacity to integrate those multiple sensory inputs based on the likelihood that they are derived from the same event or from different events."
