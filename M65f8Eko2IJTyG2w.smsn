@title "We know that the information provided by any individual sensory modality is not always veridical, but is subject to a myriad of modality-specific distortions. Thus, the brain’s ability to compare across the senses and to integrate the information they provide is not only a way to examine the accuracy of any individual sensory channel but also a way to enhance the collective information they make available to the brain. For each sense provides different information about the same event and can inform its counterparts. As a result, their aggregate neural product is more salient and more accurate than that provided by any individual sense. It is this interaction among multiple senses and the fusion of their information content that is captured by the term “multisensory integration.”"
