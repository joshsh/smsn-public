* :GFWQlcQiBlk7p3Eb: "The problem is that there is no precise definition of a ‘cue’ [51,52]. The cue concept is  dealt with as implicitly understood. For example, most people agree that cues to visual depth include perspective signals, disparity, shadows, shading, motion parallax and occlusion. And cues from touch and audition can also provide depth information (Figure I). However, because of the lack of a precise definition of a ‘cue’ there is the potential for confusion, especially when talking about cue combination and what rules to apply [4,41,53–55]."
