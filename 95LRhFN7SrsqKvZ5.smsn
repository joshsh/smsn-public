@title artists and writers feel it : there are things we need to express, to ourselves and to each other, that we have not yet, because expression is hard.  everyone knows things that would blow someone else's mind. but we can't just go around shouting at each other.  we need natural places to collect our ideas, and natural ways to selectively browse writing.
