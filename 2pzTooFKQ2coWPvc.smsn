@title known symbols like e.g. etc. seem like they should be treated as 0-level text, not relationship templates. but sometimes sentences end on etc. If the next word is capitalized and not (part of) a proper noun, then it's clear a sentence ended, but in either of the other two cases it's ambiguous without at least somewhat* understanding the sentence
