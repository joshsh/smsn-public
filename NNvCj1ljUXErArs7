* :NNvCj1ljUXErArs7: the acid is produced right away: "according to research published by Dr. John Featherstone of UCSF, acid production occurs within seconds of bacteria's exposure to sucrose, and salivary pH drops from a neutral of 7 to acidic 4.5 within just five minutes. It then takes 30 minutes to return to 7; so waiting till the meal is over to brush allows the bacteria ample time to produce acid"
