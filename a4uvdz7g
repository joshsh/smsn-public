* :4uvdz7g: In other words, although blood glucose levels stay normal, milk spikes insulin. And if we recall, insulin is a potent inhibitor of fat oxidation (Manore & Thompson, 2000; McArdle et al., 2001). However, soy milk has been shown to have both a low glycemic and insulinemic index (Blair et al., 2006; Torres et al., 2006). Thus, soy milk allows one to stay in fat-burning mode longer.
