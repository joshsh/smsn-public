@title theories confirmed by existing evidence are sometimes dismissed as "ad hoc", but are sometimes wildly successful (e.g. Newton's laws, which were confirmed on evidence by Galileo and Kepler, and Einstein's theory of relativity, which were confirmed by evidence of the constant speed of light and the anomalous orbit of Mercury)
