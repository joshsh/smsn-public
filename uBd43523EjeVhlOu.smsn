type family Contains (a :: Type) (b :: k) :: Bool where
  Contains a a     = 'True
  Contains a (f x) = Or (Contains a f) (Contains a x)
  Contains _ _     = 'False

`b` can be of any kind. So for instance, if `b` is `Maybe Int Char`,
then the second equation will decompose `b` into `Maybe Int` and `Char`.
