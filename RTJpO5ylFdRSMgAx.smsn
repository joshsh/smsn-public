@title type the three-key chords for the appropriate bracket character.  These modify the chords for 'a' (angle brackets), 'c' (curly brackets), 'p' (parentheses), and 's' (square brackets) such that the keys of the letter are pressed, then either the first (for right/close) or second (for left/open) remaining unused key is pressed and the letter keys are released before the extra key is released.  It's experimental and difficult.
