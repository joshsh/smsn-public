@title it was a great flight. At first, we weren't sure if we would be able to go up, as the left nav light was out, and there was no time to have it fixed before the flight, which would have us landing after sunset. We opted to get out quickly and come back early. As a beginner who hasn't touched my E6B in a while, I was also concerned that we had only 6 gallons in each tank, but this was no factor for a flight of less than an hour. Yet another concern was my malfunctioning headset; it gave me audio in only one ear, and I once again disconnected my voice recorder while troubleshooting, and therefore have no recording of the flight. In the end, it was enough that one of us could hear ATC clearly, and we departed without further ado. I did better with the radio calls this time, though not perfectly well: ground control asked me to read back their exact instructions because I hadn't repeated the whole taxiway route -- Z to Y via B, then on to 31R. I would like to jot down ATC instructions on a kneeboard next time. I have not quite mastered the tailwheel takeoff yet, this being my second attempt. Once in the air, however, I turned us immediately toward Mission Peak, then followed the traffic pattern to the right, passing just to the outside of the lake. I had climbed a little too steeply and lost too much airspeed in the process, so I had to level out for a moment before continuing our ascent. IIRC, I trimmed for the ascent, then trimmed again for level flight after practicing some Dutch rolls, as always, while heading out to the practice area. There, I leaned the mixture and did a clearing turn before starting in on power-off stalls. Logan had me fly at cruise speed, then reduce power to idle and maintain best angle of climb until the stall and recovery. I quickly learned to release back-pressure on the stick at the right moment, without moving the aelerons, and to apply back-pressure again at the right moment of the recovery. We also practiced holding the plane in a nose-high attitude with full power, turning the plane in small circles using only the rudder. I again got to practice forward slips on the way back down, though Logan took over for the final phase of the landing, much to my disappointment. I will try to convince him to let me land lext time. I had done alright with the inbound radio calls, obtaining the landing clearance and giving the tower an ident when requested.
