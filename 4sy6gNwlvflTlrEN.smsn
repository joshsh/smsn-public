@title I still had the white plastic fronts which had broken off of two of the keytops, so I simply reattached them with Gorilla wood glue. For the third, I seem to have lost the original front, but I had another broken-off front which I used instead, breaking and filing the original keytop so that it more or less fit together with the replacement front. The results of this repair are not perfect, but much better than the "missing teeth" appearance of the keyboard before the repair. Unfortunately, I seem to have lost the many complete keytops I could use as replacements in the future -- then again, these are easily purchased online.
