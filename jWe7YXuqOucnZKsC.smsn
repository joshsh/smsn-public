@title to print a new kneeboard sheet, export the slide deck to PDF, open in Acrobat Reader, and print the needed page from there. Trim the two halves of the sheet with the paper cutter, align them, and place them in a laminator sleeve, leaving adequate space for the punched holes on what will be the inner edge. Laminate the sheets (it is most efficient to do two at a time), then separate them and cut off the excess plastic with the paper cutter. Punching the holes in the right place is somewhat of an art.
