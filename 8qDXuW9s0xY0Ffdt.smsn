@title rather than transitioning through KSJC airspace again, I chose to simply go around it in a clockwise fashion, keeping below the KSFO class B shelves. This gave me an opportunity to enjoy the city lights without getting busy with communications and following ATC instructions. I snapped a few pictures from the air. Although this was a very pretty flight, again better planning would have reduced my workload. I had to keep checking Foreflight for the bottoms of each shelf, whereas I could have just picked a route and a sequence of altitudes while on the ground, then flown it with confidence. At one point, I came rather close to an approaching plane, forcing me to think about right of way procedures. It was interesting because, although I was a few hundred feet below the other plane (giving me the right of way), we were also converging with the other plane to my right (giving the other pilot the right of way). Although we were nearly head-on (which would suggest altering course to the right), since the other plane was slightly to the right, it made more sense to deviate slightly to the left, which I did, also remaining at a lower altitude rather than continuing my climb. The other plane did not seem to alter its course. In the darkness, I could not tell what type of plane it was, or how close we had come.
