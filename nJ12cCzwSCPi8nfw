@title [markdown][Semantic Synchrony](http://www.github.com/synchrony/smsn/wiki) is an open-source (free) knowledge graph editor. A knowledge graph is what lets Google, Siri, WolframAlpha, probably the CIA, and others answer questions about the world. Unlike those systems, this one is easy to use -- much easier than Microsoft Word or Minecraft -- and more general. (Systems with fixed schema, by definition, limit what can be expressed.)
