* :imasSZa8rEx5r9o3: "The same is true if the chosen standards are borrowed from the modality which is supposed to be compensated. Noticeably, compared to visual perception, the number of objects which can be jointly accessed or available through sensory substitution devices seems to be much lower. Contrary to vision, where people have been shown to be able to track multiple objects (e.g., Pylyshyn, 2004), users of sensory substitution devices have not been shown to be able to track or identify multiple objects at once."
