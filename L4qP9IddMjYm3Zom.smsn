@title "Writing systems have been designed to preserve the phonemic structures that are relevant to access semantic information. In this sense, the code remains “auditorily phonemically” constrained or governed. The acquisition of reading itself relies on existing phonemic skills, not just on auditory perception, and consists in mapping what one hears onto what one sees through the mediation of what one knows the later means. It is only as a result of mapping the known written signs to known spoken words and phonemes that readers can progressively entertain auditory representation on the basis of visual words, and this even for unknown or novel items."\u201Cauditorily phonemically\u201D constrained or governed.
