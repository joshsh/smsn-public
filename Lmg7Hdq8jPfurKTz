Rapport is believed to be crucial to develop trust, to create closeness, and be included in a group [22], as well as to help interactions feel smooth [36]. In industry, managers and sales people are often taught specific nonverbal techniques to promote rapport with colleagues and clients [19]. Tickle-Degnen et al [37] conceive of rapport as being the experience of three components: mutual attentiveness, positivity, and coordination, each of which is encoded and decoded through nonverbal communication. For example, coordination (sometimes termed “interactional synchrony”) has been defined as a combination of postural synchrony and movement synchrony [7]."
