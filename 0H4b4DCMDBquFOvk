* :0H4b4DCMDBquFOvk: recommendations for an ectomorph: You should concentrate on gaining weight in the form of good, lean muscle tissue. Weight training should be fairly heavy and done at a slower workout pace with longer rest periods between sets. Don't weight train too often or for too long per training session. Eat a diet high in quality foods, eat more than you're used to, and eat often. Keep aerobic activities to a minimum.
