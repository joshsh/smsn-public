@title this lesson was all landings with Jason. It was my first lesson with Jason since my stage 1 check, and I think there was a little context-switching in terms of different expectations from the instructor. However, we got a record 12 landings in, as I kept landing short enough that I never needed to back-taxi. My pattern on the east side was a little tight, though Jason did not comment on it; I can go just a little wider so as to overfly the skate park. Jason likes holding off on the roundout until the plane has nearly reached the ground, and I think I now prefer this style, as well; it avoids the situation where you drop out of the air when you stall.
