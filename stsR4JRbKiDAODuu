I had slowed to be in the then-slow right side (taking the last split (somehow long) of the 210 into Old Town Pasadenam into the north not the west fork). My phone spoke, confused me. I tried to speed up to get into the left side. I had room but feared I had not sufficiently checked behind me on the left, so I tried to abort that speed. I skidded for a long time, at least the length of Ellen's house's depth(when you're standing in front of it). I remember thinking near the end of the slide (not verbatim) "this won't be as serious as I just imagined". Have not told Geico yet. 2017-07-14
