* :mPQYH8NsQ71Byg46: "The question remains of how to interpret the frontal positivity in synesthetic subjects in the present study. Following the reasoning of Elbert and Rockstroh, this frontal positivity would have to be interpreted as an inhibition of the frontal lobe, which in turn should lead to an increased distractibility and possibly to a leakage between the modalities. An alternative interpretation draws on the notion that frontal areas are richly endowed with multisensory neurons and that this area could serve as the anatomical site in which synesthesia occurs."
