* :6obmaM5C9SQABJPB: Dance is nonlinear. Each move can be followed by certain other moves, and the dancers know which transitions are natural. They choose moves together, on the fly, responding to each other and the music on a second-by-second basis. Each dance has the potential to be something completely unique.
