@title I would rely on the default order, if available, of binding characters ordered by their characters, and bind $ after everything else but before a trailing (.) (to reflect that in English . ends a sentence). But I would sometimes specify things like "where + <(binds first) <" because it would be faster than editing what I had written to match that rule.
