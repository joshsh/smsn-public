* :NheJxsX: the striped breton shirt as we know it today came into being shortly following the 27th March, 1858 Act of France which introduced the navy and white striped knitted shirt as the uniform for all French navy seaman in Brittany.  The shirt was originally known as marini√®re or matelot.[8] The original design featured 21 stripes, one for each of Napolean's victories.
