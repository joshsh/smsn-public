* :yRyvfjq6Av8Y4OBF: "Singla et al. [146] proposed a single HMM model for two residents. The model can not only represent transitions between activities performed by one person, but also represent transitions between residents and transitions between different activities performed by different residents. As such, their probabilistic models of activities are able to recognize activities in complex situations where multiple residents are performing activities in parallel in the same environment."
