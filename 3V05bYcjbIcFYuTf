* :3V05bYcjbIcFYuTf: "the comparison with reading shows that learning to use a sensory substitution device should not be thought of as occurring “horizontally”: Sensory substitution devices do not have to fit within the concept of a sense even if they apparently serve similar functions (i.e., identification and localization). On the contrary, they help introducing the notion of vertical integration: they do not fit among the sensory modalities but also they require the existence of (some of) these modalities. Sensory substitution devices are built up from existing sensory modalities both in terms of the receptors that they use, and of the invented code they rely on."
