* :-6SscrV: if someone doesn't like you and decides not to be your friend, don't take it personally.  There are a lot of potential friends out there.  At his college, Alex would make friends at one club or other, and if he made a mistake and they didn't like him any more, he would move on to another group who accepted him.  Don't worry about one person not wanting to be your friend.
