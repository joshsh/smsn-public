Roll my local repos back to the last commit I made myself -- that is, without the changes I had pulled too early.

Export onto that.

Make a "patch": git diff > diff.txt

Checkout the latest versions from github.

"apply" the patch: git apply patch.txt

It complained that some of the changes didn't apply. I sampled some, and in all cases it was because the change had already been made. Not sure how. *shrug*
