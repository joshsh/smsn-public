* :AnJt9CNjbVREVExl: "In his paper, Adolphe Hirsch reports on chronoscopic experiments concerning the speed of various sense impressions and nervous conduction. Hirsch had conducted these experiments in 1861 with regard to the so-called personal equation, i.e. the problem of individual errors in astronomical observers. To measure the "physiological time" of various test subjects (among them Hipp), he used the chronoscope. In the paper for the Untersuchungen, he gave a detailed description of the Hipp chronoscope."
