* :tfSIK5FI1u2xWQN0: "It is important to reiterate that the correlation between hippocampal activity and perceived semantic congruency occurred during a low-level odor detection task.

This implies that hippocampal-mediated reactivation of olfactory-visual semantic associations was obligatory, not requiring the engagement of intentional memory."
