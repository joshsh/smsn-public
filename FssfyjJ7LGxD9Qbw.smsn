@title calibration ofthe activity index counter is achieved by applying a selected set of repetitious accelerations to the device, and serves to assure comparability from monitor to monitor. From several choices, we selected a pendulum with adjustable periods ranging from 2 sec to .5 sec (.5-2 Hz), so that response within the bandwidth of interest may be recorded. The device is mounted with its sensitive axis perpendicular to the arc of the pendulum's swing
