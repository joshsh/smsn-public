I can reliably repeat it now. I have a big collection somewhere, of nodes that I suspect might be broken; I'm reading through them to see if in fact they have the parents they should have. I'll read through the top few, decide they're okay, and delete them. After that I'll visit the node N that's at the top of the list. Close that, return to the big list. Now I switch to forward view (I'm already in it) and the view reverts to a view of N.

That bug has bitten me pretty good. If I recognize a collection X, I don't read the title at the bottom of the screen to make sure it's X; I assume I know where I am. But that title appears to be able to change without changing the contents of the buffer, so I'll make an edit, and rather than editing X, I'll have copied all of X's contents into Y, and deleted Y's. It's happened a few times already, with a node with on the order of 1000 children (the one I was using to hold the list of everything I had committed to fix the first recognized instance of the bug).
