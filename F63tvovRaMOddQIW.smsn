@title we took off before sunset and landed around 1/2 hour after sunset. The light level was pretty low, but it wasn't completely dark for the landing. Despite Logan's statument that I would need to study up on X, Y, and Z, and have lessons on A, B, and C before learning to land, he allowed me to handle the entire approach right down to the runway. I hit the runway too hard with the tailwheel, at which point, Logan took over to recover and land safely. Next time, I need to hold off in ground effect before touching down, even if it means that the tailwheel will touch first (which it did in spite of my efforts). Logan initially let me control the takeoff, but pushed the stick forward for me (to lift the tailwheel) when I failed to do so. I then pulled back to takeoff, and handled the plane for the remainder of the flight, modulo a couple of powered-stall demos by Logan. The powered stalls, along with clearing turns, were the bulk of the lesson. As we were descending toward UTC, I asked Logan to teach me the forward slip, which turns out to be quite simple. I practiced a lot of Dutch rolls during the south-bound portion of the climbout, and was able to achieve a higher roll angle than I had last time. I made my first four radio calls (ground from AA, tower before takeoff, tower for approach and landing, and ground to AA), bungling the first one but doing OK with the rest. Remember: who you're calling, who you are, where you are, what you need. Don't forget to repeat the tower's instructions verbatim (i.e. no "roger"). The airport was easily spotted on the basis of the PAPI lights, but the actual runway lights were harder to see until we got pretty close; you just needed to know where the runway was in relation to the PAPI lights. It was a great lesson. Unfortunately, I did not make an audio recording, as the recorder took the blame for a problem with our radio until we had disconnected the recorder and found that the radio was set to COM2 instead of COM1. I will try to record the next flight.
