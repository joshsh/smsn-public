@title "To deal best with our current semantic problem, it might be most advantageous to refer to our field not as one that investigates ‘Multisensory Integration’ but rather one that investigates ‘Multisensory Processing.’ In addition, it might be best to acknowledge that the latter term probably captures the operation of more than a single underlying perceptual or neural process and may take many forms. As such, the term ‘Multisensory Processing’ would be interpreted as a generic overarching term describing processing involving more than one sensory modality but not necessarily specifying the exact nature of the interaction between them."\u2018Multisensory Integration\u2019 but rather one that investigates \u2018Multisensory Processing.\u2019 In addition, it might be best to acknowledge that the latter term probably captures the operation of more than a single underlying perceptual or neural process and may take many forms.
