* :EsW1FpklGnZXql5d: Dietze [Philosophische Studien, II. 362] found that the most favorable intervals for clearly catching strokes were when they came from 0.3s to 0.18s apart.  40 strokes might then be remembered as a whole, and identified without error when repeated, provided the mind grasped them in five sub-groups of eight, or in eight sub-groups of five strokes each.  When no grouping of strokes beyond couples was allowed, 16 was the largest number that could be clearly apprehended as a whole.  This would make 40 times 0.3s, or 12 seconds, to be the maximum filled duration of which we can be both distinctly and immediately aware.
