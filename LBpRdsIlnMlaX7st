* :LBpRdsIlnMlaX7st: one nice thing about using the experience sampling method purely for personal applications is that all considerations of validitity and reliability of the data (first-person accounts of subjective experience) and interpersonal comparisons of data are unnecessary.  There is only one experimental subject, and it is a basic assumption that all subjective information in EoB is truthful/sincere.
