* :sUNVHtMAC7BcgWro: it may help to diagram your research as a node, "data collection and analysis", connecting your research question with two or more potential research outcomes.  You should be able to describe why each of those outcomes would tell you something useful and significant, but you should not be able to predict which one you will find (otherwise the research is probably too trivial to bother with).
