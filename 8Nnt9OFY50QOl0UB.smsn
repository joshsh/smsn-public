@title although the brain becomes "aware" of an event 0.5s after the primary EP (stimulus), the brain appears to antedate the event to the primary EP.  This is evident in patients with certain types of stroke, who have lost this ability and thus perceive events as occurring 0.5s after the stimulus.
