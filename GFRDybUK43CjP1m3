* :GFRDybUK43CjP1m3: there are philosophical arguments both for and against this trend. E.g. Jeremy Bentham may have argued that a carefully managed society results in maximization of happiness.  Others would argue that the homogenization of society is unhealthy, and reduces humans to cogs in a larger piece of machinery.  There is a risk of reducing a person's value to their usefulness to society (leading in extreme cases to eugenics and fascism)
