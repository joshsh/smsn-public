* :oK2L3jqfaQZeQHkV: If you are sharing a graph with someone else, their personal and private notes are invisible to you. (Actually you could share the personal ones too; it depends how you set up your git repositories. But this describes one reasonable configuration.) If a public note has a private note as a child, that private note will be invisible to everyone except its owner. However, those non-owners will still see an empty line in its place, indicating that something is there.
