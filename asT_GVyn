* :sT_GVyn: "The sound-induced flash fission illusion was successfully replicated. However, when the sources of the auditory and visual stimuli were spatially separated, perception of the illusion was unaffected, suggesting that the “spatial rule” does not extend to describing behavioural responses in this illusion. We also find no evidence for an associated “fusion” illusion reportedly occurring when multiple flashes are accompanied by a single beep."
