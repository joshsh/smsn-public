* :5GCRH1jzUsSJXTcM: e.g. when you slam on the brakes to avoid hitting a boy who runs out in front of your car.  You may hit the brakes in as little as 150ms after the visual stimulus, well before conscious awareness, and then report being immediately aware of the boy.  This is not a simple spinal reflex, but a fairly complex mental process.
