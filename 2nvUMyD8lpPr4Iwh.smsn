@title "The ability of millions of average Web users to publish short, timestamped and even geotagged microblog posts, at a moment's notice, presents new opportunities for real-time and location-based services. Much as these services are changing the nature of search on the Web, so the Semantic Web will be both challenged and enhanced by real-time content. Furthermore, the ability to annotate microblog posts using highly expressive vocabularies, as in Twitter's upcoming Twannotations functionality, will provide an endless stream of up-to-date, structured information about the world. In this presentation, we discuss a semantic data aggregator which brings together structured microblog annotations with Semantic Web vocabularies and best practices in order to augment the Semantic Web with real-time, user-driven data, enabling a new breed of query services. Emerging formats, modeling issues, publication and data ownership of microblog content, data storage and basic techniques for real-time, real-place semantic search are presented."
