* :Oqvp0308rSZ83cd7: I have not yet developed any new habits, in terms of note-taking, which really take advantage of the flexibility of Brain-mode; I'm still treating it like a giant page of PG notes which I can search and navigate through.  I do adjust the weight and sharability of atoms, but I don't really derive any benefit from those properties yet.  Occasionally I perform a manual merge of equivalent atoms (e.g. if a certain person is mentioned in two places, using two distinct atoms).  I don't have a good sense of whether to attach new items to the link or target of a note, and I generally default to the target, attaching to the link only when the attached info is obviously related to provenance.  I rarely navigate through link views.
