* :Bhz9lgdC3t4HIRWC: consider stamped or tooled belts, or plain leather ones with interchangeable buckles. Colored leather, canvas, or cloth belts can be a great way to turn an outfit from just “sharp” to “unique,” so long as you don’t go overboard (the belt should never be the most noticeable piece)
