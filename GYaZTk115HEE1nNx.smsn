@title experimental setup: headphone speaker was placed directly on top of the sound detector. Photoresistor was mounted on a breadboard which sat beneath the MacBook's display in a dark room. Initially, the screen is almost completely black. When I press a button, the 440 Hz tone and a color change of the screen to bright white are triggered at the same time.
