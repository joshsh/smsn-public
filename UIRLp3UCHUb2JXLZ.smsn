@title people have limited memory, cannot directly observe some behaviors (e.g., sleep apnea), and may not have the time to constantly and consistently observe some behaviors (e.g., manually counting steps throughout the day). Reflecting by using memory alone makes it difficult to see patterns and trends. People may also not have the expertise or knowledge to make the correct conclusions about their observations
