* :uNcQhptcjmrk0vYL: there is no way to completely confirm a hypothesis using experimental evidence, as proving that it is true in all contexts would require an infinite amount of evidence.  Therefore, scientists should seek to falsify their claims, not to confirm them.  In this (Karl Popper's) view, "science progresses by subjecting a hypothesis to increasingly stringent tests, until the hypothesis is falsified, so that it may be corrected, improved, or give way to a better hypothesis."
