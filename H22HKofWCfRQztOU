* :H22HKofWCfRQztOU: Daily, I taxonomize my world, and my own mind. I enjoy watching the borders shift between beliefs, values, preferences, goals and behaviors. Is patience a value or a habit? Is there a difference between a problem and an opportunity? Using semantic networks to model the mind, and using graphs of a user's writing to learn about the user, is of great interest to me.
