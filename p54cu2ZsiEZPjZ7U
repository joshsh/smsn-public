* :p54cu2ZsiEZPjZ7U: "Advanced Research and Development Activity (ARDA) of the U.S. Government sponsored a “Challenge Project on Video Event Taxonomy” to further this goal [of a common representation for describing recognized events in video] in the summer and fall of 2003. The project brought together more than 30 researchers in computer vision and knowledge representation and representatives of the user community. It resulted in the development of a formal language for describing an ontology of events, which we call VERL (Video Event Representation Language) and a companion language called VEML (Video Event Markup Language) to annotate instances of the events described in VERL."
