@title for the feasibility of tail-recursion, what are the general implications of the fact that a variable cannot be referred to by a clause unless it has been defined by an earlier one?

Example: this works, but it's not tail-recursive:
leno([],0).
leno([_|T],N)  :-  leno(T,X), N  is  X+1.

This would be tail recursive, but it doesn't work:
leno([],0).
leno([_|T],N)  :-  N  is  X+1,   leno(T,X).
```
