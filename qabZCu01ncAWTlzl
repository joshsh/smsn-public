* :qabZCu01ncAWTlzl: although it may be difficult or impossible to separate displacement and rotational components, higher frequencies may favor the displacement component, with considerable overlap, which makes it desirable to reject the very low frequencies.  Cutoff frequencies often fall in the range of 0.1-0.5Hz.
