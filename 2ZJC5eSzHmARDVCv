* :2ZJC5eSzHmARDVCv: Feynman says he is not necessarily looking for a grand unifying theory.  If it turns out that there is such a unifying theory, that's great, but we shouldn't decide in advance what we are looking for; we should simply try to find out more about nature.  It may be that nature is best described in never-ending layers of complexity, like an onion, and that would just be the way it is.
