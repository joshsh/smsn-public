@title "That presented a small problem, because I got bored rereading the same stories every night.  How many times can you recite One Fish, Two Fish before going nuts?  I began interjecting subtle modifications, being careful to ensure my changes flowed just as smoothly as the Doctor's original material.  My fish became aggressive, and the gremlins acquired weapons.  I thought the changes lived up to the Seuss standards, but Cubby almost always caught me, and quickly too.  'Read it right!' he'd yell.  No matter how nicely it rhymed, the original Dr. Seuss never said things like, 'the one in back, he has a gun,' or, 'black fish, blue fish, I'll eat you, fish."
