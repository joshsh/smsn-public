* :7O55XvNvGBbvqWTl: A: It depends on whether you are nice to your magnets.  If two magnets are forcibly strapped together with like poles touching, they will eventually demagnetize each other.  If the magnets are slammed on the ground or heated, they will also become demagnetized.  But if your magnets are minding their own business, or if they are attached to each other with opposite poles touching, they will stay magnetized forever.  In other words, it takes energy to demagnetize a magnet.
