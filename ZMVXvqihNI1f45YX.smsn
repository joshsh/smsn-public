@title "The solution chosen by many approaches to ontology-based context modelling is to use expressive logical languages, such as F-Logic [36] or first order logic [28, 38], which come at the price of less efficient reasoning. An alternative is the context-oriented logical language (for brevity called CL in this article) proposed in [35], which we use in this article as a context modelling language (Sect. 4). Although in several ways less expressive than OWL, CL supports hierarchical reasoning over multiple domains."
