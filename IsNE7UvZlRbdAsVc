* :IsNE7UvZlRbdAsVc: "because such results challenge linguistic accounts of crossmodal correspondences (see Martino & Marks', 1999, semantic coding hypothesis or the idea that these might be ‘metaphorical’ mappings), at least for chimps. Ludwig et al.'s (2011) results are all the more important in that they provide perhaps the first compelling demonstration that animals can match features between modalities in a way that is not simply explainable by their picking-up on an amodal stimulus property, such as shape (as demonstrated by research on the crossmodal transfer of shape information between vision and touch; e.g., Ettlinger & Wilson, 1990; Meltzoff & Borton, 1979; Parker & Easton, 2004), nor are they reducible to the pick-up of some sort of sensory equivalence between, for example, auditory and visual stimulus intensity (see Lewkowicz & Lickliter, 1981)"
