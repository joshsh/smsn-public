@title LSB relates to the digital representation of the measured acceleration. This basically tells you the accuracy of your output reading. In other words, if the accelerometer has a rating for 3 mG/LSB, then when the lowest order bit in your output changes, your acceleration has changed by 0.003 G's, or 3 mG
