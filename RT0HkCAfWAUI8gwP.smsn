@title [markdown]Together, the bullet and the space after it contain some hidden text, which specifies the note's ID. Recall that the ID is like the note's address in the graph. The ID is what lets Emacs know which note it is talking about. (The text content of the note is not enough information to do that, because two notes can say the same thing.) You can test this yourself: you might see a note that looks like `· groceries`, but if you paste it into another application, you will instead see something like `· :UbllhFaDamiTeUcm: groceries`.\u00B7 groceries`, but if you paste it into another application, you will instead see something like `\u00B7 :UbllhFaDamiTeUcm: groceries`.
