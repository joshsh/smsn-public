@title "Numerous studies show that practice can result in performance improvements on low-level visual perceptual tasks 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. However, such learning is characteristically difficult and slow, requiring many days of training 6, 7 and 8. Here, we show that a multisensory audiovisual training procedure facilitates visual learning and results in significantly faster learning than unisensory visual training."
