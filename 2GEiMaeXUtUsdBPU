install Tailor in WebOS (see YouTube video(s) for instructions)
in Tailor, repartition the hard drive
ideally (I am told):
    600mb system, 200mb cache, 400mb media, rest goes to data
Tailor insisted on at least 4gb or so for media, so I settled for:
    600mb system, 200mb cache, 4883mb media, 6953 data, 32mb unused
several partitions had to be checked and repaired repeatedly until all were OK
download the appropriate CyanogenMod, Google Apps, and ClockworkMod recover for the device
boot into the old ClockworkMod recovery, then side-load the new CWM.  Reboot
side-load CM and Google Apps.  Reboot into CM
