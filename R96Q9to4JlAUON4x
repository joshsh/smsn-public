@title "In some cases of sensory substitution or reading, a minimal competence arises without training through the direct association of a certain novel stimulus with a referent given through another modality: as much as children can learn to associate the complex visual form of a certain word with its phonology, and/or its referent – for instance, associate the visual look of the word “car” to the sound (car) and from there to what they know about cars – novice users of auditory-to-visual devices like the vOICe can learn to associate a set of auditory patterns obtained through their headphones to an object recognized by touch (and/or labeled by the experimenter). Such an associative strategy though is unlikely to generalize and predicts that same amount of effort/time will be needed to learn every novel item."
