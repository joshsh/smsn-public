@title multiple rows for one voice

@text Sometimes it might be right to use multiple rows to represent different parameters of a single voice. Traditional music notation does this with accents and pitch -- the accents ride above the top of the staff, while the piches wander around inside it. (The two "rows" in this case would be "above the staff" and "in the staff".)
