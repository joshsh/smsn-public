@title "For spoken letters, the sound of the voice (e.g. male versus female) typically has no effect on a letter's color. For written letters, most synesthetes report that the way the letter is written (e.g. font or case) has no effect on a letter's color. Thus the neural networks that represent visual shape or auditory timbre without letter identity do not represent the information required to mediate this form of synesthesia."
