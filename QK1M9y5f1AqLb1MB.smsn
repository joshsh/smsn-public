@title FIPA includes an experimental specification\footnote{\url{http://www.fipa.org/specs/fipa00093/index.html}} for converting between message transport protocols and between concrete encodings of FIPA-message parts.  ``FIPA-MIS can be used where direct end-to-end interoperability is impossible, impractical or undesirable.''
