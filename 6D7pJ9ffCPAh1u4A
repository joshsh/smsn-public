* :6D7pJ9ffCPAh1u4A: computing machines are very fast and very accurate, but they are constrained to perform only one or a few elementary operations at a time.  They are single-minded, constrained by their pre-programming.  They naturally speak nonredundant languages, usually withonly two elementary symbols and no inherent appreciation either of unitary objects or of coherent actions
