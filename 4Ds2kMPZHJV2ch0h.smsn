@title not having a clear plan for approaching the airport (both PAO and SQL). I was neither familiar enough with the ground features nor did I have a specific point and heading in mind for joining my intended straight-in approach path. I was fastidious about frequencies and communications, and this went well enough, but I was complacent about navigation.
