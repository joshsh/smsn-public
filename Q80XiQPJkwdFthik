* :Q80XiQPJkwdFthik: previously, only 2098 of 69203 atoms were private, as private sharability was fairly narrowly defined, being used mainly for password hints, very personal log entries, and other potentially compromising information.  As I have begun demoing Extend-o-Brain more frequently, I have found it necessary to make the personal level of visibility safter to share, and that required moving items like account information, financial, medical, and insurance information, logs of purchases and doctor visits, personal information about other people, and so on into the private sharability space.  During this process, I selected three random sets of atoms which had personal sharability at the time, and inspected each atom to determine the proportion of false negatives w.r.t. those which should be private.  Out of the very first set of 200 atoms, before I had started this massive effort, 41 or around 20% were eventually found to be atoms which should have been private.  After I had finished the main round of changes and committed revision 6afedb28, I selected 1000 atoms which were then personal and repeated the process, finding that 38, or 3.8%, should have been private.  This triggered further changes.  I did one more test of 1000 atoms the next day (2014-11-01) and found 26, or 2.6%, which should have been private.  It seems these numbers can only fall gradually with time now that I have exhausted the top-down approach of turning major hierarchies private.
