after a day that would otherwise have been almost entirely sitting-down work, I did some running on a hill. I wanted, had kombucha right after it. Slept shortly thereafter, woke four hours later, closed windows. Was hungry after that, but went back to sleep. Five hours later, awake again, I ate like I normally do: little in the morning. It's 3:20 now and I still haven't had any protein.
