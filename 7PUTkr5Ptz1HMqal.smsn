@title for the time being, I have more or less given up on distinguishing facts that are true at present from facts which were true at some time in the past.  Notes may talk about time, but they are not subject to strict temporal constraints.  For example, I no longer distinguish (strongly) between my current possessions and past possessions (e.g. childhood toys and the defective RFID reader which I returned to the seller).  I am interested to see how this "timeless" model of reality evolves in Extend-o-Brain, and what consequences it will have.
