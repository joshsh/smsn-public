* :9JT82zXyHS0TYd4A: "There could not be a more entertaining treat than dinner at the James house, when all the young people  were at home.  They were full of stories of the oddest kind, and discussed quiestions of morals or taste or literature with a vociferous vigor so great as sometimes to lead the young men to leave their seats and gesticulate on the floor.  I remember, in some of these heated discussions, it was not unusual for the sons to invoke humorous curses on their parent, one of which was, that "his mashed potatoes might always have lumps in them!"
