* :tgyGwo0: "In this paper, we present initial results that extend the TinyDB sensornet query engine to support more sophisticated data analyses, focusing on three applications: topographic mapping, wavelet-based compression, and vehicle tracking. We use these examples to motivate the feasibility of implementing sophisticated sensing applications in a query-based system"
