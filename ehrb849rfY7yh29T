* :ehrb849rfY7yh29T: "One of the most important aspects of eye gaze is its referential nature. Eye gaze points to the target of another’s attention and intention, and help us identify and share attention and communicative topics (Baron-Cohen, 1995; Bloom, 2000). Understanding the referential nature of gaze may also be a requirement for the development of theory of mind. For example, BaronCohen (1994, 1995) argues that the shared attention mechanism (SAM), which represents triadic relations between self, other and the object, is the basis of the development of the theory of mind mechanism (ToMM), which infers others’ mental states."
