* :L0VzXeTDt2MPZz51: "In view of previous findings that without prior visual stimulation a monotonic increase in cardiac response to the same range of auditory stimuli results, this finding of a significant quadratic relationship with loudness suggests that the infants were responding to the auditory stimuli in terms of their similarity to the previously presented visual stimulus. A separate group of infants presented with a more intense visual stimulus exhibited a shift in the intensity at which a minimal cardiac response occurred."
