.
  lift heavy, slow, for more tension
    use close to max weight at least sometimes
  maximum tension (flexion), regardless of resistance
  high tension is incompatible with fatigue
    train not all the way to failure
    push your limits of weight|tension, not reps|exhaustion
    pause and relax between reps
  five or fewer reps, rest 3 to 5 min between sets, 2 sets
