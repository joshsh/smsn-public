@title for instance, as funny as would be for bran to tell everyone "I like turtles" and try to engage them in discussions of turtles at every opportunity, it's an ineffective way to share the important turtles information with the people who need it.  better to record "bran likes turtles" (or even "bran likes turtles, according to jeff") as a two-member relationship, once, in the graph. From then on, a turtle-evangelist can skip the costly preaching, and instead grow the value of the knowledge graph around turtles: "videos of turtles overcoming great odds", "how turtles sleep", "the flatoing ballast effect of the ribs of turtles" ...  then, if someone wants to hear about animals bran likes, or animals overcoming great odds, or any other related kind of search, they will be led to bran's prized turtle information.
