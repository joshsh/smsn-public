@title I have used my knowledge base to reprogram myself. (Indeed, lately Josh and I are reprogramming each other.) Once while reviewing my knowledge base I discovered cognitive bias toward trying to solve or share a problem before fully understanding it. Since putting that into words, my stamina for focused study has improved.
