* :KdDJH0sLTXhKkuss: a study of computer processor design at the levels of the instruction set, the system architecture, and logical gates. Knowledge of Boolean algebra and digital circuits are combined with a viewpoint of computers at the assembly language level to build a complete understanding of how modern computer processors actually work, with some techniques and tradeoffs that go into their design. The simulation of digital circuits using a high-level procedural programming language is also covered. A programming project will be required
