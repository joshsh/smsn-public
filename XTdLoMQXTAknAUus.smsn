@title yes.  "^" is a hold-over from my pre-SmSn notes, where I used it extensively.  I haven't really found a suitable plain-English replacement.  "A ^ B" means "that thing that will come to mind when I think of A and B at the same time".  It's usually a personal association which no-one else is likely to share.  E.g. "Brown's Mountain ^ Perseids" represents "that time I watched the Perseid meteor shower from Brown's Mountain".  Most "^"s should be personal because they will seem cryptic to others.  In the example you linked, you can see what I'm talking about, but the "^" cues me to a specific memory I have about these topics together.
