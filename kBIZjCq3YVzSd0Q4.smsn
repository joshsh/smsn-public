@title let S be a source schema and T a target schema. Then a SO tgd is a formula of the form ∃f1 ... ∃fm( (∀x1(φ1 → ψ1)) ∧ ... ∧ (∀xn(φn → ψn))), where each fi is a function symbol, each φi is a conjunction of atoms from S and equalities of terms, and each ψi is a conjunction of atoms from T\u2203f1 ... \u2203fm( (\u2200x1(\u03C61 \u2192 \u03C81)) \u2227 ... \u2227 (\u2200xn(\u03C6n \u2192 \u03C8n))), where each fi is a function symbol, each \u03C6i is a conjunction of atoms from S and equalities of terms, and each \u03C8i is a conjunction of atoms from T
