@title "Kant seeks to establish the applicability of the Newtonian spatio-temporal framework to experience, given that it is not itself an object of experience. His strategy is to show that the organization of experience in terms of a world of enduring substances undergoing mutual causal interaction is a necessary condition of the temporal ordering even of one’s own subjective states, and thus of coherent experience itself. According to this view, it is because all experience is subject to this condition that it is possible to make universally valid claims about causality in nature – such as Newton’s laws of dynamics"\u2019s own subjective states, and thus of coherent experience itself.
