@title participants had to judge whether the moment at which a graphical object collided with a virtual wall occurred simultaneously with the moment at which a force was felt through a force feedback joystick.  Participants either moved the joystick to drive the object (active touch) or held the joystick in a steady position while the object moved by itself (passive touch).
