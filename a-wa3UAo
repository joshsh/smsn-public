* :-wa3UAo: hands should be shoulder width apart with the middle fingers pointing forward (according to a yoga practitioner).  It'll be easier to keep yourself from falling forward if your fingers are bent, not straight.  Yoga lady says keep your legs straight up, another source says bending your knees so they're pointing up or forward helps with your balance.  To get into the handstand, plant your hands and kick your legs up, one after the other.  Then keep your legs locked together.  "Stay tight!"
