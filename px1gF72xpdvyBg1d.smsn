@title on 2018-12-16, I decided that this is not a good tuner for the clavichord, as the notes do not sustain long enough to hold the tuner's needle in place for a reliable reading; instead, you get a kind of ballistic reading which shoots up and immediately falls back. In contrast, you get a very stable reading when you hold a tuning fork up to the tuner's microphone.
