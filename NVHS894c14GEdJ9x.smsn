@title "We therefore expected that the effect would be observed even in retinal positions other than the exposed positions. However, the effect was not observed at 5.0° and 20.0° right of fixation, when subjects were exposed to the apparent motion with tone bursts at 10.0° right from the fixation, implying a fairly rigid localization of the aftereffect."
