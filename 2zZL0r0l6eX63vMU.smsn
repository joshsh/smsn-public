@title [markdown]For knowledge we can define a similar concept, the "relevance diameter": the maximum distance between pieces of information that are relevant to each other -- the kind we wish were found near each other. A small relevance diameter is good, because we never have to travel farther than the relevance diameter in order to find something we need.
