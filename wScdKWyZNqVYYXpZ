* :wScdKWyZNqVYYXpZ: "It is possible to listen to any sound either in terms of its attributes or in terms of those of the event that caused it. For instance, while listening to a string quartet we might be concerned with the patterns of sensation the sounds evoke (musical listening), or we might listen to the characteristics and identities of the instruments themselves (everyday listening)."
