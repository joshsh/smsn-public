* :VWjtDrNQZDi3RAN3: Two researchers presented a work in progress. Dr. William Hirstein, Director of the Cognitive Science Lab at Elmhurst College, Illinois, showed how Skin Conductance Response (SCR) in autistic children has no baseline, instead moving through dramatic highs and lows. He suggested that hand flapping and body swaying are ways of calming down and self-regulating for autistics, their way of finding a "normal window." Carlos Elguero of the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, then presented the Squeezevest, a device in progress that can be worn by autistic children to regulate SCR. Based on the principle that firm touch and squeezing from the sides appears to have a calming effect on autistic children, the Squeezevest provides automatic activation in a non-invasive manner, is portable, and will have a relatively low cost. The design is being refined for further testing and evaluation.
