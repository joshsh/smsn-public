* :Qfp01TEs46vvFNmD: you should know about trees. You should be familiar with binary trees, n-ary trees, and trie-trees at the very very least. You should be familiar with at least one flavor of balanced binary tree, whether it's a red/black tree, a splay tree or an AVL tree. You should actually know how it's implemented. You should know about tree traversal algorithms: BFS and DFS, and know the difference between inorder, postorder and preorder.
