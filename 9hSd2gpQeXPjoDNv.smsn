@title Suppose (as is true) my graph code uses some events from my life as examples, and those events ties into cycles involving nodes such as myself and abstract goals like chivalry or inquiries|mysteries like mortality. That is,suppose all of my data about myself is (through edges created for an unrelated purpose) a descendent of "graph code|land", and I want to share graph code|lang but not all of my notes on myself.
