@title "A candidate explanation for the multisensory group's advantage is that presentation of sound has an alerting effect, which could benefit the multisensory subjects' task performance and lead to greater learning. We consider this explanation to be unlikely for two reasons. First, in the initial training session, both groups begin training with nearly identical performance, with their paths diverging later in the session; if sound has an alerting effect, it would cause an advantage from the beginning. Second, there is no difference between a silent and a noise condition (in the direction test) after training. Neither one of these by itself is conclusive evidence against alerting, but the two put together (no difference at the beginning or at the end) strongly suggest against it."
