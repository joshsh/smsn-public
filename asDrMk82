* :sDrMk82: "an examination of sighted individuals who are trained with visual feedback could provide useful information about the basic mechanism behind visual substitution learning,  their learning would suggest that the substituted visual information can be extracted on the basis of learning of the direct relationship between images and the corresponding sounds [...] This approach allowed us to study visual-to-auditory substitution learning in the simplest and most direct way by examining the extent to which the original visual information could be recovered from the auditory information."
