@title "The experience of everyday listening may serve as the foundation for a new explanatory framework for understanding sound and listening. Such a framework would allow us to understand listening and manipulate sounds along dimensions of sources rather than sounds. So for example, we might imagine a psychoacoustics concerned with measuring peopleâ€™s ability to hear the forces involved in events, or a synthesiser that allowed us to specify whether a sound source was wood or metal."
